booktitle: "Proceedings of the V Workshop Thesis and Dissertations on Databases"
title: "Bioinformatics scientific workflows: combining databases, AI and Web services"
abstract: "Bioinformatics activities present new challenges, such as how to exchange and reuse successful experimental procedures, tools and data, and how to understand and provide interoperability among data and tools across different sites, for distinct user profiles. This thesis is an effort towards these directions. It is based on combining research on databases, AI and scientific workflows, on the Semantic Web, to design, reuse, annotate and document bioinformatics experiments. The resulting framework allows the integration of heterogeneous data and tools and the design of experiments as scientific workflows, which are stored in databases. Moreover, it takes advantage of the notion of planning in AI to support automatic or interactive composition of tasks. These ideas are being implemented in a prototype and validated on real bioinformatics data."
