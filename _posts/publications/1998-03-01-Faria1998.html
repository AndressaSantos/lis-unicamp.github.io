title: "A Spatio-Temporal Database for Development of Applications in Geographic Information Systems"
abstract: "Abstract This dissertation discusses the implementation of an extensible framework, which provides support for the development of spatio-temporal database applications. The infrastructure, developed on the O2 object-oriented database system, consists of a kernel set of operators and database classes, which meet the minimum requirements for the processing of spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal queries. The main contributions of this work are the specification of the kernel operators and classes and their implementation, validated through a pilot geographic application. Another contribution is the analysis of this implementation, which discusses problems and shortcomings of some models proposed in the literature."
