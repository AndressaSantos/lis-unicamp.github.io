title: "Discovering Geographic Locations in Web Pages Using Urban Addresses"
abstract: "This paper presents an approach that helps to discover geographic locations from the recognition, extraction, and geocoding of urban addresses found in Web pages. Experiments that evaluate the presence and incidence of urban addresses in Web pages are de- scribed. Experimental results, based on a collection of over 4 mil- lion documents from the Brazilian Web, show the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method."
