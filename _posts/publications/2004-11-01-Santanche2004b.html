title: "Geographic Digital Content Components."
abstract: "Projects using geographic information tools involve a large variety of data objects, represented in different formats. Many efforts pursue standards to represent each kind of data object, and the interoperability between geographic information tools. The proliferation of data and tools raises the need for their reuse. This need can be extended to project reuse. This work presents a proposal to reuse geographic information projects based on a model called digital content component. This model can represent all elements involved in a project – including software components – and their relationship in a open homogeneous format."
