abstract: "Spreadsheets are popular among users and organizations, becoming an essential data management tool. The ease of accessing associated with the creative freedom o?ered by spreadsheets resulted in the increase of the data volume available in this format. However, spreadsheets are not conceived for integration of data from distinct sources and challenges arise involving systematization of processes to reuse and combine their data. Many related initiatives address integration of data inside spreadsheets focusing on lexical and syntactical aspects, however, the exploration of the semantics related to these data is still an open challenge. In this sense, some related work propose mapping spreadsheets contents to open interoperability standards, mainly Semantic Web standards. The main limitation of such proposals is the assumption that it is possible to recognize and make explicit the schema and the semantics of spreadsheets automatically regardless of their domain. This work di?ers from related work by assuming the essential role of the context ? mainly the domain in which the spreadsheet was conceived ? to delineate shared practices of the community, which establishes building standards to be automatically recognized by our system, in a data extraction process and schema recognition. In this paper we present a result of a practical experiment involving such a system, in which we integrated data from hundreds of spreadsheets available on the Web. This integration was possible due to a unique ability of our approach of recognizing the spreadsheet nature, analyzed inside its creation context."
