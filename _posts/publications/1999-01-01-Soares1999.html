title: "Integrating Legacy Systems to Heterogeneous Databases"
abstract: "This paper presents a methodology to construct a federated database infrastructure to help the integration of heterogeneous data sources and which takes legacy data into account. This methodology considers different kinds of data sources and systems to be combined, and gives guidelines to integrate the data for each situation. The last step of the methodology consists in an algorithm that produces mappings from queries on the federated system to the set of queries on the database that participate in the federation. The methodology was validated by a case study on databases and legacy systems of the municipal administration of Paulinia, SP."
