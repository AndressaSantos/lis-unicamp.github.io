title: "Unifying Phenotypes to Support Semantic Descriptions"
abstract: "In life sciences, there are several biological datasets shared through the web. All this abundance of data carries a great opportunity to explore complex relationships among the diversity of species. However, their physical format varies from independent data files to databases, which are heterogeneous in model and representation, hampering their integration. Ontologies are one of the promising choices to address this challenge. However, the existing digital phenotypic descriptions are stored in semi-structured formats, making extensive use of natural language. If on one hand, this patrimony is highly relevant, on the other hand, converting it in ontologies is not a straightforward task. The present article addresses this problem adding an intermediate step between semi-structured phenotypic descriptions and ontologies. It remodels semi-structured descriptions to a graph abstraction in which the data are linked. Graph transformations subsidize the transition from semi-structured data representation to a more formalized representation through ontologies."
