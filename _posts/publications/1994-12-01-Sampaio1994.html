title: "Dynamic Constraints in Active Object-Oriented Databases"
abstract: "This dissertation addresses the problem of modeling and enforcing general integrity constraints in database systems. The solution is based on the use of active object-oriented database management systems (DBMS) that provide support to rule mechanisms. The work proposes a strategy to be applied during application design. This strategy takes into consideration the behavior and active features of the DBMS. The strategy's goal is to represent the constraints into conceptual design using CDL - a declarative and model independent language and to provide mappings in terms of production rules responsible for constraint enforcement. The main contributions presented are: the proposal of a taxonomy for integrity constraints in modeling information systems; the specification of the CDL constraint language; general heuristics for mapping constraints expressed in CDL into production rules in the active database; and the specification of the characteristics needed from active database in order to support general integrity constraints in information systems. This dissertation extends previous proposal found in the literature, providing support to model dynamic constraints in database system design using active object-oriented DBMS."
