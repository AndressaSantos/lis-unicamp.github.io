title: "Evaluating the Potential of Texture and Color Descriptors for Remote Sensing Image Retrieval and Classification"
abstract: "Classifying Remote Sensing Images (RSI) is a hard task. There are automatic approaches whose results normally need to be revised. The identification and polygon extraction tasks usually rely on applying classification strategies that exploit visual aspects related to spectral and texture patterns identified in RSI regions. There are a lot of image descriptors proposed in the literature for content-based image retrieval purposes that can be useful for RSI classification. This paper presents a comparative study to evaluate the potential of using successful color and texture image descriptors for remote sensing retrieval and classification. Seven descriptors that encode texture information and twelve color descriptors that can be used to encode spectral information were selected. We perform experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of these descriptors, considering image retrieval and classification tasks. To evaluate descriptors in classification tasks, we also propose a methodology based on KNN classifier. Experiments demonstrate that Joint Auto-Correlogram (JAC), Color Bitmap, Invariant Steerable Pyramid Decomposition (SID) and Quantized Compound Change Histogram (QCCH) yield the best results."
