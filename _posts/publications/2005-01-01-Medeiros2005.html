title: "From Subject of Change to Agent of Change - Women and IT in Brazil"
abstract: "Brazil has one of South America's largest information technology (IT) communities. One hundred million people voted electronically for President and congress in 2004, and 97 percent of all income tax declarations are submitted via the Internet. Over 20,000 students graduate every year in computer science alone, and two of the federal government's four industrial priorities are related to IT --- software and semiconductors. Though women represent 60 percent of the country's college graduates, less than 5 percent choose Computer Science as a major. Programs to foster gender equality have little intersection with the national digital inclusion program. This paper points out actions that may be considered to allow Brazilian women to become full citizens of the information society. These actions concern formal and informal means of education, and on visibility and advocacy."
