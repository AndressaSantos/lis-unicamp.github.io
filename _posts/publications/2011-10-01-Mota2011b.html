title: "Shadow-driven Document Representation: A summarization-based strategy to represent non-interoperable documents"
abstract: "Document production tools are present everywhere, resulting in an exponential growth of increasingly complex, dis- tributed and heterogeneous documents. This hampers document exchange, as well as their annotation, indexing and retrieval. Existing approaches to these tasks either concentrate on speciﬁc formats or require representing document’s content using interoperable standards or schema. This work presents our eﬀort to handle this problem. Rather than try- ing to modify or convert the document itself, our strategy deﬁnes an intermediate and interoperable descriptor – shadow – that summarizes key aspects and elements of a given document, improving its annotation, indexation and retrieval process regardless of its format. Shadows can be used with diﬀerent purposes, from semantic annotations and context- sensitive annotations, to content indexation and clustering."
