booktitle: "Proc. 1st e-Science Workshop -- XXII Brazilian Symposium on Databases"
title: "Applying Scientific Workflows to Manage Sensor Data"
abstract: "There is a world wide effort to create infrastructures that support multidisciplinary, collaborative and distributed work in scientific research, giving birth to the so-called e-Science environments. At the same time, the proliferation, variety and ubiquity of sensing devices, from satellites to tiny sensors are making huge amounts of data available to scientists. This paper presents a framework with a twofold solution: (i) using a specific kind of component -- DCC -- for homogeneous sensor data acquisition; and (ii) using scientific workflows for flexible composition of sensor data and manipulation software. We present a solution for publishing sensor data tailored to distributed scientific applications."
