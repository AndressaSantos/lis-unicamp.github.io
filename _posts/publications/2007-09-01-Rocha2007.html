title: "A New Hybrid Clustering Approach for Image Retrieval"
abstract: "In this paper, we present a new Hybrid Hierarchical Clustering approach for Image Retrieval. Our method combines features from both divisive and agglomerative clustering paradigms in order to yield good-quality clustering solutions with reduced computational cost. We provide several experiments showing that our technique reduces the number of required comparisons to perform a retrieval without significant loss in effectiveness when compared to flat-based solutions."
