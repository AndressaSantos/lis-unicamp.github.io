title: "Mining sensor data time series (Mineracão de séries temporais de dados de sensores)"
abstract: "Sensor networks have increased the amount and variety of temporal data available. This motivated new techniques in data mining, which describe different aspects of time series. Related work addresses several issues, such as indexing and clustering time series, and the definition of more efficient feature vectores and distance functions. However, most results focus on describing the values in a series, and not their evolution. Furthermore, the majority of papers only characterizes a single series, which is not enough in cases where multiple kinds of data must be considered simultaneously. This dissertation presents a new technique, which describes time series using a distinct approach, characterizing oscillation patterns, rather than the values themselves. The new descriptor -- TIDES (Time Series Oscillation Descriptor) -- is based on approximating the series by segments, and then extracting the angular coefficients of the segments. TIDES supports multi-scale analysis, thereby allowing to compare two series according to distinct granularities, which enables a more thorough analysis. The dissertation also presents several extensions to TIDES, which enable describing multiple series at a time. This joint description is needed to correctly characterize phenomena which evolve jointly -- the so-called co-evolution. Experiments conducted with real data on temperature, for different Brazilian cities, show that TIDES successfully characterizes time series oscillation."
