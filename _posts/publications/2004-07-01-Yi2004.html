title: "A Data Model for Moving Objects"
abstract: "The dissemination of devices like GPS and wireless networks have enabled new applications that collect and analyze mobile objects. Traditional database systems do not support the management of mobile object data, since a great amount of information is continuously generated. Research in this area is recent, with relatively few works on mobile data management. This MSc thesis proposes an object-oriented moving object data model that incorporates two characteristics: it supports modeling of static, spatial, temporal, spatio-temporal and mobile objects in a homogeneous way; it specifies a set of basic operators and their algorithmic specification. These operators can be composed to obtain a wide variety of complex operators to query a mobile object database. Unlike most other proposals, this model supports not only 1D objects, but also those with 2D and 3D geometric descriptions. http://libdigi.unicamp.br/document/?did=13826."
