title: "Query Processing in the BIOTA Biodiversity Database"
abstract: "SINBIOTASP is the biodiversity information system being developed as part of the BIOTA/FAPESP program. This thesis is focused in the implementation issues of the query processing of the SINBIOTASP system. This subject presents many challenges in the formulation and the processing of the queries, due to the variety and the volume of the data and to the wide range of system user profiles. The main contributions of this work are: a survey of the query processing features of many environmental information systems on the Web; a systematization of the query types which are typical of biodiversity application, considering processing and interface criteria; and specification of a basic set of spatial operators, as well general query interfaces, involving maps and textual data, in the context of biodiversity environmental information systems. As a final contribution, this analysis was validated by the development of the Species Mapper module of SINBIOTASP, which allows Web query processing on collection and distribution of species."
