title: "Inspecting User Interface Quality in Web GIS Applications."
abstract: "Web GIS applications can be found in many domains. The quality of the interfaces of applications determines not only the usability of such applications, but the possibilities offered to their users. This work investigates aspects of interface quality for Web GIS applications. The approach adopts an inspection evaluation based on ISO 9241. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of such an approach to user interface evaluation as a complement to tests with users."
