booktitle: "2017 Workshop on Capturing Scientific Knowledge (SciKnow), held in conjunction with the ACM International Conference on Knowledge Capture (K-CAP)"
title: "Requirements for Supporting the Iterative Exploration of Scientific Workflow Variants"
abstract: "Workflow systems support scientists in capturing computational experiments and managing their execution.  However, such systems are not designed to help scientists create and track the many related workflows that they build as variants, trying different software implementations and distinct ways to process data and deciding what to do next by looking at previous workflow results.  An initial workflow will be changed to create many new variants thereof that differ from each other in one or more steps. Our goal is to support scientists in the iterative design of computational experiments by assisting them in the creation and management of workflow variants.  In this paper, we present several use cases for creating workflow variants in hydrology, from which we specify requirements for workflow variants.  We also discuss major research directions to address these requirements."
