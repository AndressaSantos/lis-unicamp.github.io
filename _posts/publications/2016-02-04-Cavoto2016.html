title: "ReGraph : Bridging Relational and Graph Databases"
abstract: "Networks are everywhere. From social interactions: family, friends, hobbies; passing through computer science: computers on the Internet; to nature: as food chains. Recent research shows the importance of links and network analysis to discover knowledge in existing data. Moreover, the Linked Open Data and Semantic Web efforts empowered the fast growth of open knowledge repositories on the web, mainly in the RDF (Resource Description Framework) graph model. However, a lot of data are stored in relational databases, whose model has not been designed to address queries with many transitive relations. On the other hand, the flexible graph model is suitable for data analysis focusing on links, their transitivity and the network topology, e.g., a connected component analysis. Therefore, our research is inspired by the data OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) approach of creating a special database designed for data analysis, a network-driven data analysis, using graph databases. In this dissertation, we present ReGraph, a framework to map data from a relational to a graph database, managing a dynamic coexistence and evolution of both, not supported by related work. ReGraph has minimum impact on the existing infrastructure, providing a flexible and tailored graph model for each relational schema. It uses an initial ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process to replicate the existing data in the graph database. A scheduled service is responsible for automatically reflecting changes in the relational data into the graph, keeping both synchronized. ReGraph also provides an annotation functionality to materialize inferences and to support data enrichment, which enables linking the local database to global knowledge graphs on the Web. We have used the ReGraph framework to generate FishGraph, a graph database created from the FishBase relational database. Using FishGraph we developed experiments to analyze the connections among thousands of identification keys and species, and we have linked local data to DBpedia, creating annotations over the local graph and providing new knowledge from existing data."
