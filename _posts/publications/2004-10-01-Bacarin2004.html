title: "A Collaborative Model for Agricultural Supply Chains."
abstract: "This paper presents a collaborative model for agricultural supply chains that supports negotiation, renegotiation, coordination and documentation mechanisms, adapted to situations found in this kind of supply chain – such as return flows and composite regulations. This model comprises basic building blocks and elements to support a chainrsquos dynamic execution. The model is supported by an architecture where chain elements are mapped to Web Services and their dynamics to service orchestration. Model and architecture are motivated by a real case study, for dairy supply chains."
