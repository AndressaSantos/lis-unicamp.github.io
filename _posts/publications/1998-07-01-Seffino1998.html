title: "WOODSS - Spatial Decision Support System based on Workflows"
abstract: "Environmental planning takes nowadays advantage of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to manage geo-spatial data. Nevertheless, GIS do not provide facilities to reuse users ́expertise in solving problems. This dissertation provides a solution to this limitation, specifying and implementing a Spatial Decision Support System. The user interactions with GIS are intercepted by WOODSS, which documents them as scientific workflows. These workflows can be edited and re-executed directly in the GIS. WOODSS thus allows documenting and repeating planning activities, as well as creating new planning strategies. It was implemented on top of the IDRISI software, and tested in the context of agro-environmental planning activities."
