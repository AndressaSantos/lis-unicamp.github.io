title: "Managing Time in Object-Oriented Databases"
abstract: "This paper presents a new approach for modelling and querying temporal object oriented databases. The model presented in this paper extends previous work in the area, by supporting the evolution of all object properties through time (inheritance, composition and behavior), and allowing temporal schema evolution. A prototype of this model is being implemented as a time-managing layer on top of the O2 object-oriented database system. In order to manipulate our temporal objects, we have extended the O2 query language with temporal constructs, which we also discuss in the paper."
