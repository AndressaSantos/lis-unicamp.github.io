abstract: "Biodiversity scientists often need to define and detect scenarios of interest from data streams concern meteorological sensors. Such streams are
characterized by their heterogeneity across spatial and temporal scales, which hampers construction of scenarios. To help them in this task, this paper proposes the use of the theory of Complex Event Processing (CEP) to detect complex event patterns in this context."
