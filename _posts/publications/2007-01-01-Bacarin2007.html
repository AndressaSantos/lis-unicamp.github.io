booktitle: "Proc. CPN 07 - Eighth Workshop and Tutorial on Practical Use of Coloured Petri Nets and the CPN Tools"
title: "Towards Modeling and Simulating a Multi-party Negotiation Protocol with Colored Petri Nets"
abstract: "E-contracting, i.e., establishing and enacting electronic contracts, has become important because of technological advances (e.g., the availability of web services) and more open markets. However, the establishment of an e-contract is complicated and error prone. There are multiple negotiation styles ranging from auctions to bilateral bargaining. This paper provides an approach for modeling multi-party negotiation protocols in colored Petri nets. It is shown how different negotiation styles can be modeled in a unified and consistent way. Moreover, CPN Tools is used to analyze the resulting colored Petri nets. Simulation can be used for both validation and performance analysis, while state-space analysis can be used to discover anomalies in various multi-part negotiation protocols."
