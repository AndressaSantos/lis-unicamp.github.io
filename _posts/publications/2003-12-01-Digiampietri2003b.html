title: "A data model for comparative genomics."
abstract: "We present a simple data model that can be used as a building block in a comparative genomics information system for prokaryotic genomes. The model is extensible and flexible, and has as main entities the organism and the gene family. Existing systems tend to focus either on organisms or in gene families. We have applied the model to a set of eight bacterial genomes, and briefly describe the resulting system."
