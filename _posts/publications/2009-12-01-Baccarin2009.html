title: "Automated Negotiation of Multi-party Contracts in Agricultural Supply Chains"
abstract: "An agricultural supply chain comprises several kinds of actors that establish a complex net of relationships. These relationships may range from ad hoc and short lasting ones to highly structured and long lasting. This kind of chain has a few particularities like strict regulations and cultural influences, and presents a quite relevant economical and social importance. Contracts are the natural way of expressing relationships among members of a chain. Thus, the contracts and the activity of negotiating them are of major importance within a supply chain. This thesis proposes a model for agricultural supply chains that integrates seamlessly their main features, including their structure and their dynamics. Specifically, the thesis proposes a multi-party contract format and a negotiation protocol that builds such kind of contracts. Multi-party contracts are important in this context because several actors of a supply chain may build alliances comprising mutual rights and obligations. A set of bilateral contracts is not well-fitted for such a purpose. The thesis also presents an implementation of the negotiation protocol that builds on Web services and a workflow engine (YAWL). (Thesis written mostly in English)."
