title: "An Infrastructure based on Web Service Choreography for Activity Coordination in Supply Chains"
abstract: "A supply chain is the set of activities involved in the creation, transformation and distribution of a product, from raw material to the consumer. Supply chainś participants can work in an integrated way to optimize their performance and increase their commercial competitiveness. From the technological point of view, the distributed, autonomous and heterogeneous nature of supply chainś participants raises difficulties when we consider the automation of interorganizational processes. This work proposes an infrastructure based on Web services choreographies for coordination of the activities that compose the interorganizational business processes of the supply chains. This infrastructure implements a coordination model that aims to make easier the design and the deployment of the interorganizational business processes. In this model, processes are represented by WS-CDL choreographies, which are mapped to executable BPEL coordination plans. The work also presents a prototype of the infrastructure to validate it."
