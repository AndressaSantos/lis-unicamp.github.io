This allows increasing the efficiency and transparency in the public bidding systems. This work presents a model of a Purchases Electronic System for public companies. This system uses the Internet as a means to support negotiation, within legal principles. The work also proposes a model to manage the supply process. This models supports integration of the proposed solution with G2B (Government to Business) electronic commerce, thereby contributing to understanding the purchase workflow within public companies in Brazil."
