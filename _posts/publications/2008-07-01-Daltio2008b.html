title: "Aondê: Um Serviço Web de Ontologias para Interoperabilidade em Sistemas de Biodiversidade (Aondê: An Ontology Web Service for Interoperability across Biodiversity Information Systems)"
abstract: "Research in biodiversity associates data on living beings and their habitats, constructing sophisticated models and correlating several kinds of heterogeneous data. Such data are provided by research groups with different vocabularies, methodologies and goals, which hampers their cooperation. Ontologies are being proposed as one of the means to solve heterogeneity problems. However, this gives birth to new challenges to manage and share ontologies. This dissertation specified and developed a new kind of Web Service, whose goal is to contribute to solve such problems. The service supports a wide range of operations on ontologies, and was implemented and validated with real case studies in biodiversity, for large ontologies. The dissertation is available on UNICAMP digital library."
