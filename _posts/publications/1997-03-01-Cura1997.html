title: "Version Management in Databases for GIS"
abstract: "Information systems contemplate version models and mechanisms for the management of multiple states of modeled entities. Versions are associated, mainly, to the management of alternatives in CAD/CASE systems and the representation of historical evolution of entities in temporal systems. This dissertation studies the use of versions in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). The focus of this work is on temporal applications, multiple representations of spatial entities, and the management of alternatives of spatial design. The main results presented are: a model and a mechanism for versions in order to support geographic applications; and the proposal of an extension to a standard OODBMS to support the model."
