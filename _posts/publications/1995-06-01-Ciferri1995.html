title: "Benchmarks for Geographic Information Systems"
abstract: "Geographical Information Systems (GIS) deal with data that are special in nature and size. Thus, the technologies developed for conventional data base systems such as access methods, query optimizers and languages, have to be modified in order to satisfy the needs of a GIS. These modifications, embedded in several GIS, or being proposed by research projects, need to be evaluated. This thesis proposes mechanisms for evaluating GIS based on benchmarks. The benchmark is composed of a workload to be submitted to the GIS being analysed and data characterizing the information. The workload is made of a set of primitive transactions that can be combined in order to derive transactions of any degree of complexity. These primitive transactions are oriented to spatial data but not dependent on the way they are represented (vector or raster). The benchmark data base characterization was defined in terms of the types of data required by applications that use georeferencing, and by the need to generate complex and controlled artificial data. The proposed technique and methods were used to show how to create the transactions and the data for a given application."
