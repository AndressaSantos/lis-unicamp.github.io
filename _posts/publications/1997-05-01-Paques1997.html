title: "An Object-Oriented Method for Developing Distributed Information Systems"
abstract: "With the increasing availability of distributed technologies, large companies have been pursuing more and more the development of distributed information system. However, there is a lack of methods that consider the distribution aspect from its initial phase (requirement analysis) to its final phase (implementation). Indeed distributed architecture specifications (e.g., OMG's CORBA) provide support only to the activities related to the software implementation process (the analysis process is not considered). This work presents an object-oriented (OO) method for developing distributed information systems which integrates concepts used on conceptual models of OO methods with concepts used in distributed architecture specifications. This integration provides a better usage of nowaday's distributed technology (e.g., distributed databases, internet, intranet, etc.). During the analysis phase of this method, objects are grouped in subsystems based on the affinity that exists among them. This grouping process is conducted in order to induce better performance for the distributed information system. Finally, the work proposes a tool that automates the object grouping process."
