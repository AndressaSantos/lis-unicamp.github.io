title: "A New Framework to Combine Descriptors for Content-Based Image Retrieval"
abstract: "Methods that combine image database descriptors have strong influence on the effectiveness of content-based image retrieval (CBIR) systems. Although there are many combination functions described in the image processing literature, empirical evaluation studies have shown that those functions do not perform consistently well across different contexts (queries, image collections, users). Moreover, it is often very difficult for human beings to identify optimal combination functions for a particular application. In this paper, we propose a novel framework using {\\em Genetic Programming} to combine image database descriptors for CBIR. Our framework is validated through several experiments involving two image databases and a specific domain, where the images are retrieved based on the shape of their objects."
