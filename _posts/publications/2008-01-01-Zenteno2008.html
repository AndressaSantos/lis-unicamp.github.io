title: "A Development Process for Web Geographic Information System."
abstract: "This paper introduces a process for developing Web GIS (Geographic Information Systems) applications. This process integrates the NDT (Navigational Development Techniques) approach with some of the Organizational Semiotic models. The use of the proposed development process is illustrated for a real application: the construction of the WebMaps system. WebMaps is a Web GIS system whose main goal is to support harvest planning in Brazil."
