title: "Designing and Implementing the User Interface of Geographic Digital Libraries"
abstract: "Geographic data are useful for a large set of applications, such as urban planning and environmental control. These data are, however, very expensive to acquire and maintain. Moreover, their use is often restricted, for lack of dissemination mechanisms. Digital libraries are a good approach for increasing data availability and therefore re足 ducing cost, since they provide efficient storage and access to large volumes of data. Geographic applications can diminish their costs by reusing and sharing data through Geographic Digital Libraries (gdl). One major drawback to this approach is that it creates the necessity of providing facilities for a large and heterogeneous community of users to search and interact with these Geographic Libraries. We present a solu足 tion for this problem, based on a framework that allows the design and construction of customizable user interfaces for gdl applications. This framework relies on two main concepts: a Geographic User Interface Architecture and a Geographic Digital Library."
