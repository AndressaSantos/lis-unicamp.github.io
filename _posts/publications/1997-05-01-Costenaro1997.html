title: "Characterization of Spatial Database Systems for Performance Analysis"
abstract: "In this thesis, the area of spatial database systems is approached using the benchmark technique for performance analysis. This technique requires the monitoring of a database system using a real or synthetic database and workload (transactions). The ideal situation is the use of synthetic data that better resemble the situations found in real applications. This thesis uses real data (spatial and non-spatial) of a telecommunications outside plant management system to validate and enhance techniques to provide more realistic synthetic data and workload and to derive conclusions useful for performance studies of database systems in general."
