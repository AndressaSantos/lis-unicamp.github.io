title: "An architecture for querying biodiversity repositories on the Web"
abstract: "Life on Earth forms a broad and complex network of interactions, which some experts estimate to be composed of up to 80 million different species. Tackling biodiversity is essentially a distributed effort. A research institution, no matter how big, can only deal with a small fraction of this variety. Therefore, to carry ecologically-relevant biodiversity research, one must collect chunks of information on species and their habitats from a large number of institutions and correlate them using geographic, biologic and ecological knowledge. Distribution and heterogeneity inherent to biodiversity data pose several challenges, such as how to find relevant information on the Web, how to solve syntactic and semantic heterogeneity, and how to process a variety of ecological and spatial predicates. This dissertation presents an architecture that exploits advances in data interoperability and semantic Web technologies to meet these challenges. The solution relies on ontologies and annotated repositories to support data sharing, discovery and collaborative biodiversity research. A prototype using real data has implemented part of the architecture."
