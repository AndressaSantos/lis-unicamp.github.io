title: "Incorporation of Spatial-Temporal Facilities in OODB"
abstract: "This dissertation presents a framework to incorporate support for spatial-temporal data in object oriented database management systems. The main contributions are: (i) Description of a spatial-temporal object oriented data model, allowing the representation of spatial-temporal data evolution, common in geographic information systems; (ii) Definition of data structures in a object oriented database to support the model, storing spatial data in the vector format. This structures make possible to store the temporal evolution of the objects, which encapsulate access methods to their temporal states; (iii) Specification of a taxonomy of spatial-temporal queries in geographic information systems. This proposal extends other GIS models, bringing the possibility to incorporate new facilities in future systems."
