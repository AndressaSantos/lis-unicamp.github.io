abstract: "This article proposes the use of image content, keywords and ontologies to improve the image annotation and retrieval processes through the enhancement of the user’s knowledge of an image database. It proposes an architecture of a flexible system capable of dealing with multiple ontologies and multiple image content descriptors to help these tasks. The validation of the idea is being done through the implementation, in Java, of the software OntoSAIA."
