title: "Managing Dynamic Repositories for Digital Content Components."
abstract: "The Semantic Web pursues interoperability at syntactic and semantic levels, to face the proliferation of data files with different purposes and representation formats. One challenge is how to represent such data, to allow users and applications to easily find, use and combine them. The paper proposes an infrastructure to meet those goals. The basis of the proposal is the notion of digital content components that extends the Software Engineering software component. The infrastructure offers tools to combine and extend these components, upon user request, managing them within dynamic repositories. The infrastructure adopt XML and RDF standards to foster interoperability, composition, adaptation and documentation of content data. This work was motivated by reuse needs observed in two specific application domains: education and agro-environmental planning."
