title: "Integration of Scientific Workflows on the Web"
abstract: "Scientists have traditionally shared data, experiments and research results. Now, they continue to do this via electronic networks and the Internet, but often without an appropriate framework. One possible approach to this problem is coordinating cooperation via scientific workflows on the Web. Our research contributes to these efforts in two directions: proposal of a model compliant with Web standards to store workflow components in databases and publish them on the Web; and development of a set of Web-based tools to specify, edit and compose workflow components."
