title: "Incorporating the Temporal Dimension in Object Oriented Database Systems"
abstract: "The last two decades have witnessed an intensive research on temporal databases. Although several results have already been achieved for temporal realtional systems, there are few proposals considering the incorporation of the temporal dimension to the development of this area. This dissertation persents the following original results: a board survey on temporal models and languages; the proposal of a new temporal model (TOODM), based on the object oriented paradigm; and the specification of a query language (TOOL) for the proposed model."
