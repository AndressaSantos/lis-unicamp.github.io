title: "Web metalaboratory"
abstract: "The amount of scientific data, services and on-line tools available on the Web offer an unprecedented opportunity to conceive new kinds of laboratories blending resources. Existing experimental and collected data can substantiate asynchronous laboratories. Combined with mashup enabled software, it is possible to produce hybrid laboratories to confront, for example, synthetic simulations with observations. This work addresses this opportunity in the Education context through our metalaboratory, an authoring environment to produce laboratories by combining building blocks encapsulated in components. We introduce here the lab composition patterns and the active Web templates as fundamental mechanisms to support a lab authoring task. These laboratories can be embedded and mashed-up in Web documents. This work shows practical experiments of producing Web virtual and hybrid laboratories."
