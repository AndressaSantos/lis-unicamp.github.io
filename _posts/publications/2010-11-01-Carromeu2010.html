title: "Spatial Monitoring of Cattle – Impact on the Carbon Cycle"
abstract: "There is a growing demand for accurate information about the real environmental impact caused by cattle, accompanied by a concern for increased production of cattle related products in a sustainable manner. With the widespread adoption of RFID chips for bovine traceability and new technologies for measuring carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, it is now feasible to develop carbon cycle models that combine such factors. This presents challenges that range from data management to model specification and validation, to correlate animal movements and their impact on different biomes. This paper presents a proposal towards this goal, concerned with the creation of a framework to store and index semantic space trajectories of livestock to enable monitoring of the production of CO2."
