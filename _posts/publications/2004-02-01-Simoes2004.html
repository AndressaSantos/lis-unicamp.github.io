title: "Detection of some abrupt transitions in video sequences"
abstract: "A digital video is represented by a sequence of images or frames. A video shot is an uninterrupted segment of screen time, space and graphical configurations. The problem of transition detection between shots can be seen as one of the most important step to the process of segmenting and parsing a digital video. In order to have an automatic detection of these events, some researches consider frame by frame comparison using dissimilarity measures based on color, form and texture information, while others apply images processing techniques over a representative image of the whole video. This work describes a new approach to detect transitions and abrupt effects (cuts and flashes) in image sequences, by considering simple and low computational cost algorithms which are defined based on patterns identification of a 1D signal. The results presented here show the good performance of the method in the identification of the corresponding events. http://libdigi.unicamp.br/document/?did=10165"
