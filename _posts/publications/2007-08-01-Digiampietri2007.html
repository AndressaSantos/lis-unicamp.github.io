title: "Management of Bioinformatics Scientific Workflows (partially in portuguese)"
abstract: "Bioinformatics activities are growing all over the world, following a proliferation of data and tools. This brings new challenges, such as how to understand and organize these resources, how to exchange and reuse successful experimental procedures (tools and data), and how to provide interoperability among data and tools across different sites, and used for users with distinct profiles. This thesis proposes a computational infrastructure to solve these problems. The infrastructure allows to design, reuse, annotate, validate, share and document bioinformatics experiments. Scientific workflows are the mechanisms used to represent these experiments. Combining research on databases, scientific workflows, artificial intelligence and semantic Web, the infrastructure takes advantage of ontologies to support the specification and annotation of bioinformatics workflows and, to serve as basis for traceability mechanisms. Moreover, it uses artificial intelligence planning techniques to support automatic, iterative and supervised composition of tasks to satisfy the needs of the different kinds of user. The data integration and interoperability aspects are solved combining the use of ontologies, structure mapping and interface matching algorithms. The infrastructure was implemented in a prototype and validated on real bioinformatics data."
