title: "Complex Objects in Digital Libraries"
abstract: "There are several applications which need support for complex objects, such as new mechanisms for managing data, creating references, links and annotations; clustering or organizing complex digital objects and their components. At this work we present a research proposal to address these issues. The objective is to specify and implement a formal and unified framework to manage multimodal complex objects in digital libraries, using the 5S formalism and Digital Content Component (DCC) aggregation."
