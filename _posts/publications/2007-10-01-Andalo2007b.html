booktitle: "8th International Symposium on Mathematical Morphology"
title: "A New Shape Descriptor based on Tensor Scale"
abstract: "Tensor scale is a morphometric parameter that unifies the representation of local structure thickness, orientation, and anisotropy, which can be used in several computer vision and image processing tasks. In this paper, we exploit this concept for binary images and propose a shape descriptor that encodes region and contour properties in a very efficient way. Experimental results are provided, showing the effectiveness of the proposed descriptor, when compared to other relevant shape descriptors, with regard to their use in content-based image retrieval systems."
