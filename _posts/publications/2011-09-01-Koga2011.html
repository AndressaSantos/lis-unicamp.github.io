title: "Handling and Publishing Wireless Sensor Network Data: a hands-on experiment"
abstract: "eScience research, in computer science, concerns the development of tools, models and techniques to help scientists from other domains to develop their own research. One problem which is common to all fields is concerned with the management of heterogeneous data, offer- ing multiple interaction possibilities. This paper presents a proposal to help solve this problem, tailored to wireless sensor data – an im- portant data source in eScience. This proposal is illustrated with a case study."
