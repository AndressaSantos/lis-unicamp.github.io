title: "An Environment for Management of Images and Spatial Data for Development of Biodiversity Applications"
abstract: "There is a wide range of environmental applications requiring sophisticated management of several kinds of data, including spatial data and images of living beings. However, available information systems offer very limited support for managing such data in an integrated manner. On the one hand, environmental applications based on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) allow spatially correlating geophysical data and information on living species. On the other hand, image information systems used by biologists provide management of photos of landscapes and/or animals, but without any kind of geographical referencing. This thesis provides a solution to combine these query requirements, which takes advantage of current digital library technology to manage networked collections of heterogeneous data in an integrated fashion. The research thus contributes to solve problems of specification and implementation of biodiversity information systems that manage images of species, textual descriptions and spatial data in an integrated way, under the digital library perspective. This solution provides biodiversity researchers with new querying options. The main contributions of this thesis are: (i) a generic architecture, based on digital library components, for managing heterogeneous data collections, to access biodiversity data sources (text, images, and spatial data); (ii) a proposal of new shape descriptors for supporting content-based image retrieval; (iii) a new digital library component, for content-based image search; (iv) adoption of distinct visual structures for exploring query results in an image database; and (v) partial validation of the architecture, through implementation of a prototype that uses fish-related data."
