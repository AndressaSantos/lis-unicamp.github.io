title: "Comparative Analysis of the Use of Relational and OO Models in GIS"
abstract: "Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are known as non-conventional applications, and so they need different methodologies from those used for conventional applications. However, most of existent GIS in the market use conventional tools. The goal of this thesis is to verify, through an example - UNINet, the use of ER and object oriented models (OMT) in a GIS. THe modeling and implementation in relational (SQL92) and object oriented DBMS (O2) are analyzed, deriving the results."
