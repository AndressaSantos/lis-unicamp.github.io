title: "Access Control in Geographic Databases"
abstract: "The access control problem in databases consists in determining when (and if) users or applications (WHO) can access stored data (WHAT), and what kind of access (HOW) they are allowed. Most of the research in this area is geared towards management of relational data, for commercial applications. The objective of this thesis is to study this problem for geographic databases, where constraints imposed on access control management must consider the spatial location context. The main contributions of this work are: (a) overview of requirement analysis for access control in geographic databases; (b) definition of an authorization model based in spatial characterization; (c) discussion of the implementation aspects of this model (d) analysis of how this proposal can be adopted by a large scale telecommunications AM/FM spatial application, the SAGRE System. Sagre is an outside plant management geographic information system, developed at CPqD foundation, in use in most telephone operator service providers in Brazil."
