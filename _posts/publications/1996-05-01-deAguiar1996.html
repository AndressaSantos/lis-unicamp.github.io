title: "Building an Unified Basic Model from Stand-Alone Systems"
abstract: "Urban planning is one of the main areas that use geographic information systems. The base of the urban planning implementation is the Basic Urban Mapping (BUM), which is the set of graphic and alphanumeric informations related to the cartographic base of the cadastral plant. The BUM modeling depends on the necessity and purpose of the applications and the investment directed for this, besides different feelings of users. In this way, different applications in general don’t share their models during the development of their applications, increasing their cost. This paper describes an integration experience of two real life applications: Telebrás (Telecomunicações Brasileiras S/A) and Eletropaulo (Eletricidade de São Paulo S/A)."
