title: "Data Quality and Interoperability in GIS"
abstract: "Interoperability in GIS is an issue of growing importance, due to the increase in number and volume of available data sources and to the exponential expansion of new applications and systems. Research in this area involve solutions directed towards the different layers of an information system (interoperability based on common interface design, process interoperability or interoperability through data). The goal of this paper is to point out issues concerning interoperability at the data level. In particular, the text analyses issues related to the quality of geographic data as an additional dimension that must be taken into consideration in the cases of data migration and integration."
