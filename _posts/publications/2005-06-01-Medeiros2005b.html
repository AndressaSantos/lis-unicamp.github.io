title: "Remote Sensing Research at the State University of Campinas, Brazil"
abstract: "The State University of Campinas (UNICAMP) is one of Brazil’s foremost universities, being responsible for 15% of the country’s scientific publications. Every year, over 50,000 students from all over the country apply to enter one of the university’s 60 undergraduate courses, and only 10% meet the strict entrance examinations. Created over 35 years ago to be a research-oriented university, half of its 30,000 students are enrolled in graduate programs, and the University awards every year 1000 Masters and 700 PhD degrees. Still another 14,000 people are enrolled in continuing education courses. This student body is taught by 1800 faculty, 97% of which have PhD degrees. This profile of student and faculty qualification, allied to good research facilities, provide very good opportunities for innovative research, involving both graduate and undergraduate students. Remote sensing (RS) research, by nature multidisciplinary, has found in UNICAMP a good environment to flourish. Several laboratories conduct work on different aspects of the use of this technology, involving faculty with distinct profiles. Rather than one single center dedicated to RS aspects, several laboratories develop initiatives in this area, with distinct application domains in mind. This paper gives a brief overview of the work conducted along two distinct domains – agriculture and geology – with projects resulting from cooperation of experts in computer science and in the study and application of RS to these domains. It must be stressed that other groups in the university also conduct work involving remote sensing technology – e.g., for biodiversity analysis – but this paper presents a good sample of relevant ongoing projects. The authors work in four distinct laboratories, but collaborate in various research and training activities. As will be seen, a few of the projects described in the sections that follow involve people from all laboratories concerned."
