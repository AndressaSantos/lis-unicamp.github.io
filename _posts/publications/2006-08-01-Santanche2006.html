title: "The Fluid Web and Digital Content Components: from a document-centered to a content-centered view"
abstract: "The Web is evolving from a space for publication/consumption of documents to an environment for collaborative work, where digital content can travel and be replicated, adapted, decomposed, fusioned and transformed. We call this the Fluid Web perspective. This view requires a thorough revision of the typical document-oriented approach that permeates content management on the Web. This thesis presents our solution for the Fluid Web, which allows moving from the document-oriented to a content-oriented perspective, where ̈contenẗ can be any digital object. The solution is based on two axes: a self-descriptive unit to encapsulate any kind of content artifact - the Digital Content Component (DCC); and a Fluid Web infrastructure that provides management and deployment of DCCs through the Web, and whose goal is to support collaboration on the Web."
