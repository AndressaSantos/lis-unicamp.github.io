title: "Relationships among educational materials through the extraction of implicit topics"
abstract: "Digital educational documents are growing in size and variety, catering to an increasingly heterogeneous public. As a consequence, students are facing difficulties to find their way through such material. Several scientists have created online repositories to store and facilitate access to these documents. Unfortunately, in most such repositories documents are stored in a haphazard way. This hampers distinguishing among contents of these materials, as well as their retrieval. As a consequence, students interested in accessing relevant material revert to (traditional) Web search engines, or to browsing through one specific repository. In most cases, the results of invoking those search engines are presented as a set (or disjunction) of potentially interesting documents, which may not be adapted to the learning purpose. One of the initiatives that have emerged to solve this problem involves the use of automatic classification algorithms, e.g. Topic Modeling and Topic Labeling. However, them remains the difficulty to analyze implicit relationships among topics of materials and lecturers from different places, even within a single repository. Moreover, these solutions have not been applied to sets of documents with different formats, and do not take advantage of additional information - e.g., metadata to extract topics. This work presents CIMAL, a framework for flexible analysis of educational material repositories; CIMAL combines semantic classification, taxonomies and graph structures to extract topics and their multiple relationships. We validated our proposal through a prototype that uses real materials from Coursera (Johns Hopkins University and University of Michigan) and Higher Education Institute, from Brazil. As far as we known, this is the first time that both slide and video features guide text analysis, topic classification techniques and relationship discovery among documents. The elicitation of topics covered in various educational documents and of their potential relationships can support teachers and students in undertaking academic activities that are more dynamic than conventional ones – e.g., in which new relationships are found between different subjects from different sources. This can also make it easier to search the most appropriate items in educational repositories to learn new concepts, enhancing the development of new courses. From the computational point of view, this research contributes to the improvement of techniques for handling unstructured documents and documents of different formats."
