title: "Generation and Indexing of Spatio-Temporal Data"
abstract: "The goal of the dissertation is the design, implementation and evaluation of an access structure for spatiotemporal data. The dissertation is a collection of four papers written in English, with an introduction and a conclusion written in Portuguese. The first paper presents a survey of spatial data indices and traditional data persistent indices. In addition, the paper describes a novel structure, the HR-tree, as well as its algorithms to insert, delete, update and search data. The second paper addresses the development of an algorithm to generate spatiotemporal data, called GSTD (Generate Spatiotemporal Data). The algorithm allows the generation of spatiotemporal data following A few statistical distributions for some user defined parameters, that control, for example, the initial spatial location, the dinamicity of updates (in time) and the spatial data movements. The third paper presents a comparison of the HR-tree to two other structures. The first one is a 3D spatial structure, based on the R-tree, that treats time as another dimension. In that structure, the initial and end time of the objects have to be known beforehand. The second one is basically a structure that combines two spatial structures, also based on the R-tree: a 2D structure that indexes current objects (i.e., objects with an end time unknown) and a 3D structure that indexes objects alread closed (i.e., objects with initial and end time known). The fourth and last paper describes an application of the HR-tree in another problem domain, namely bitemporal data indexing. The overall conclusion of this work is that the HR-tree has the best performance (when compared to the other two structures) to answer spatial queries in a specific point in time and for small time intervals, but the HR-tree is much bigger than the other two structures. However, nowadays space requirements are not as problematic as response time, hence, we believe the HR-tree is a good access structure for spatiotemporal data."
