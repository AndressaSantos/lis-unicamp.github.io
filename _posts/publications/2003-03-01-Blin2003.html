title: "A Reuse-oriented Workflow Definition Language."
abstract: "This paper presents a new formalism for workflow process definition, which combines research in programming languages and in database systems. This formalism is based on creating a library of workflow building blocks, which can be progressively combined and nested to construct complex workflows. Workflows are specified declaratively, using a simple high level language, which allows the dynamic definition of exception handling and events, as well as dynamically overriding workflow definition. This ensures a high degree of flexibility in data and control flow specification, as well as in reuse of workflow specifications to construct other workflows. The resulting workflow execution environment is well suited to supporting cooperative work."
