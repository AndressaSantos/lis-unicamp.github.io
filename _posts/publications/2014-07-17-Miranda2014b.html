title: "Towards a Linked Biology - An integrated perspective of phenotypes and phylogenetic trees"
abstract: "A large number of studies in biology, including those involv- ing phylogenetic tree reconstruction, result in the production of a huge amount of data – e.g., phenotype descriptions, morphological data ma- trices, etc. Biologists increasingly face a challenge and opportunity of effectively discovering useful knowledge by crossing and comparing sev- eral pieces of information, not always linked and integrated. Our moti- vation stems from the idea of transforming these data into a network of relationships, looking for links among related elements and enhanc- ing the ability to solve more complex problems supported by machines. This work addresses this problem through a graph database model, link- ing and coupling phylogenetic trees and phenotype descriptions. In this paper we give an overview of an experiment exploiting the synergy of linked data sources to support biologists in data analysis, comparison and inferences."
