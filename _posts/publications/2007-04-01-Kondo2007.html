title: "Management of traceability in food supply chains"
abstract: "A supply chain is a set of activities developed starting from raw materials to final consumers. Supply chains present many research challenges in Computing, such as the modeling of their processes, communication problems between their components, logistics or process and product management. An issues of increasing importance is to enable traceability to ensure the origin and quality control of the products. However, little has been published on implementation aspects to solve this problem. Most papers are related to specific aspects, and do not strive for generic solutions. This work contributes to fill this gap, considering product, process and service traceability within a supply chain. The main contributions are a model for traceability data storage, supported by Web Services-based architecture. This work presents was validated by a prototype, whose tests shows the genericity of the solution."
