title: "Relating educational materials via extraction of their topics"
abstract: "Digital educational documents are growing in size and variety,
and scientists are facing difficulties to find their way
through them. One of the initiatives that have emerged to
solve this problem involves the use of automatic classification
algorithms. However, it is difficult to analyze implicit
relationships among topics of materials. This paper presents
CIMAL, a framework for enabling flexible access to material
stored in arbitrary repositories. CIMAL combines semantic
classification, taxonomies and graphs to elicit relationships
among topics of educational documents. We validated
our work using materials from Coursera (courses offered by
Johns Hopkins University and University of Michigan) and
a Higher Education Institute, from Brazil."
