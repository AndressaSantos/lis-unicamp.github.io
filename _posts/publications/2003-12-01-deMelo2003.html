title: "Use and Application of Economic Models in Geomarketing Information Systems"
abstract: "Survival in the business world depends on knowledge of oneś clients and competitors. A crucial factor in this competition is the ability to manage business data within a geographic context. The search for efficiency in decision making motivated the emergence of geomarketing, which combines marketing policies and strategies to information systems and the geographic location of the resources manipulated. This work aims to fill a gap in this nascent area, by combining results in economic models, computer science and geoprocessing. The main contributions of this dissertation are: a) a survey of the theoretical basis underlying information systems applied to geomarketing, both in economic modeling and computer science aspects; b) analysis of software engineering methodologies applied to the development of geomarketing applications; and c) implementation of a real life case study in geomarketing, adapting a specific economic model, and coupling it to a geographic information system."
