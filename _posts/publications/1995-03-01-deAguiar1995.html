title: "Heterogeneous Database Integration into Urban Planning Applications"
abstract: "The name Geographic Information Systems (GIS) denotes software that handles georeferenced data - data connected spatially to the earth surface. Modern GIS are based in relational database systems, extended to efficiently support georeferenced applications. Recent studies indicate that the object oriented paradigm is more adequate for this type of system. However, the migration of relational to object oriented systems is costly. This dissertation presents a solution to this problem, which consists in defining mechanisms that allow the integration of the present (relation based) systems and the new (object based) systems, with emphasis in urban applications. The architecture proposed integrates object oriented and relational DBMS designed, respectively, using the OMT and ECR models. In order to allow this integration the dissertation developed primitive operations for mapping between both data models, as well as primitives for converting OMT schemas into schemas of the O2 object oriented DBMS. This proposal was validated through the integration of two real life applications which use the basic elements of urban planning: Telebr s' telephone network management system and Eletropaulo's electrical network management system."
