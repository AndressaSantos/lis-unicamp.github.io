title: "Sensor Data Publication on the Web for Scientific Applications"
abstract: "This paper considers the problems of sensor data publication, taking advantage of research on components and Web service standards. Sensor data is widely used in scientific experiments -- e.g., for model validation, environment monitoring, and calibrating running applications. Heterogeneity in sensing devices hamper effective use of their data, requiring new solutions for publication mechanisms. Our solution is based on applying a specific component technology, Digital Content Component (DCC), which is capable of uniformly encapsulating data and software. Sensor data publication is tackled by extending CPTs to comply with geospatial standards for Web services from OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium). Using this approach, Web services can be implemented by CPTs, with publication of sensor data following standards. Furthermore, this solution allows client applications to request the execution of pre-processing functions before data is published. The approach enables scientists to share, find, process and access geospatial sensor data in a flexible and homogeneous manner."
