title: "Serial Annotator : managing annotations of time series"
abstract: "Time series are sequences of values measured at successive time instants. They are used in several domains such as agriculture, medicine and economics. The analysis of these series is of utmost importance, providing experts the ability to identify trends and forecast possible scenarios. In order to facilitate their analyses, experts often associate annotations with time series. Such annotations can also be used to correlate distinct series, or look for specific series in a database. There are many challenges involved in managing annotations - from finding proper structures to associate them with series, to organizing and retrieving series based on annotations. This work contributes to the work in management of time series. Its main contributions are the design and development of a framework for the management of multiple annotations associated with one or multiple time series in a database. The framework also provides means for annotation versioning, so that previous states of an annotation are never lost. Serial Annotator is an application implemented for the Android smart phone platform. It has been used to validate the proposed framework and has been tested with real data involving agriculture problems."
