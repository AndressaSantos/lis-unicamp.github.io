title: "Combining Databases and Case Based Reasoning for Decision Support in Environmental Planning"
abstract: "Environmental planning takes advantage of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS) for problem solving. These softwares supply integrated frameworks which permit users to deal with data and models in analysis and simulation tasks. However, they usually provide generic models which need to be specialized to fit particular situations. Since this process requires considerable effort and expertise, it is crucial to allow planners to profit from others' experience. The goal of this dissertation is to develop mechanisms to help environmental planners to solve problems incrementally. The solution presented here consists in coupling Case-based Reasoning (CBR) to the WOODSS spatial decision support system (WOrkflOw-based spatial Decision Support System), developed at the LIS laboratory at the Institute of Computing, UNICAMP. WOODSS interacts with a Geographical Information System and provides model handling facilities, documenting them by means of scientific workflows. The focus of this work is on specifying and implementing new model storing and retrieval modules for WOODSS, using CBR techniques. The main contributions of this research are: (a) requirement eliciting for using CBR in environmental decision support; (b) development of model management algorithms founded on CBR; and (c) extension of the WOODSS system, making it more suitable for problem solving from precedent cases."
