title: "Modelling Geographic Information Systems using an Object Oriented Framework"
abstract: "Geographic information systems demand the processing of complex data using specialized operations, not available in traditional database systems. Even though there exist commercial systems that provide some of these facilities, there is a lack of proper support, which should cover not only the implementation but also the design stage. This paper answers this latter need, discussing the steps for modelling databases for geographic information systems using the paradigm of object orientation."
