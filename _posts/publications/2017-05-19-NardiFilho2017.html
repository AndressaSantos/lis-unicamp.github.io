title: "Hybrid Narrative and Clinical Knowledge Base for Emergency Medicine Training"
abstract: "Software for medical training usually follows two types of approaches for the representation of its data. One type is the software of simulation-based training or virtual patients - which have highly structured representations of the clinical data and simulation plans. Another type is some systems which focus on the narrative of a clinical case in free-text format - e.g., the Jacinto emergency medicine learning environment. In this case, the clinical data mixes with the narrative in unstructured format. Thus, we propose a model for a hybrid narrative and clinical knowledge base for emergency medicine training that combines both of the approaches. We hypothesize that by connecting narratives with structured clinical information, we can take advantage of the strongest points of each approach. On the one hand, structured clinical data offers flexibility for the production of case variations and alternative plans, which gives machine more autonomy to assess user performance. On the other hand, free-text narratives enable the introduction of real scenario relevant aspects and context, beyond clinical data. In this work, we present a practical experiment involving the database of the Jacinto emergency medicine learning environment."
