title: "Rule Application in GIS - a Case Study"
abstract: "Production rules in database systems have been used mostly for integrity-related issues (e.g., derived data maintenance, authority checking and constraint verification). This paper analyzes the need for using production rules in geographic information systems, for a special family of applications---utility management systems. This framework is applied to a real life large scale application---the development of an integrated database system for the maintenance and expansion of the telephone network in Brazil."
