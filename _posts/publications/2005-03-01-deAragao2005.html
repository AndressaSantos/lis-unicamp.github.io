title: "GeoMarketing: Models and Systems, with Applications in Telecommunications"
abstract: "The goal of geomarketing is to manage and combine spatial and business data for decision support within the domain of marketing application. This concept is evolving to include other application domains. However, the models proposed are seldom properly implemented; moreover, existing systems are not extensible, and support only one specific simulation model. This thesis contributes to solving these issues. The main contributions are the following: (1) proposal of a conceptual architecture for a geomarketing information systyem, that takes into consideration new methods and technologies; (2) a comparative study of distinct types of spatial marketing models and techniques; (3) identification of some kinds of problems in the telephone/telecommunications domain that can profit from the use of such techniques; (4) validation of the architecture by means of a Web geomarketing prototype, VoroMarketing. This is a modular and extensible prototype, which supports the use of distinct spatial models; (5) configuration of the prototype to solve specific problems in the telecommunications domain."
