title: "Design and Implementation of a Metadata Database for the Biodiversity Information System of the State of Sao Paulo"
abstract: "This dissertation presents the design and implementation of the metadata database of the information system for the BIOTA/FAPESP program. This is a long term scientific program that aims the establishment of a common basis for cooperation among different researchers on biodiversity and the dissemination of their work, to give subsidies to the creation of environmental preservation programs in the State of SÃ£o Paulo. The metadata database is the system component responsible for the high level description of several biodiversity data collected by researchers. This dissertation discusses different aspects of the development of this database, situating it in the context of a biodiversity information system. The main contributions presented are: a) survey of several proposals for metadata standards, for environmental data; b) proposal of a metadata standard for the biodiversity information system that encompasses other proposals and extends them in order to consider environmental aspects; c) design of the metadata database; and d) implementation of a prototype of the information system, with emphasis on its metadata aspects."
