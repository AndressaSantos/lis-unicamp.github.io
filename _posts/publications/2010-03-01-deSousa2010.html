title: "Management of Semantic Annotations of Data on the Web for Agricultural Applications (partially in english)"
abstract: "Geographic information systems (GIS) are increasingly using geospatial data from the Web to produce geographic information. One big challenge is to find the relevant data, which often is based on keywords or even file names. However, these approaches lack semantics. Thus, it is necessary to provide mechanisms to prepare data to help retrieval of semantically relevant data. To attack this problem, this dissertation proposes a servicebased architecture to manage semantic annotations. In this work, a semantic annotation is a set of triples - called semantic annotation units - < subject,metadata field, object >, where subject is a geospatial resource, (metadata field) contains some characteristic about this resource, and object is an ontology term that semantically associates the metadata field to some appropriate concept. The main contributions of this dissertation are: a comparative study on annotation tools; specification and implementation of a service-based architecture to manage semantic annotations, including services for handling ontology terms; and a comparative analysis of mechanisms for storing semantic annotations. The work takes as case study semantic annotations about agricultural resources."
