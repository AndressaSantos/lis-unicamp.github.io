title: "Um Serviço de Gerenciamento de Coletas para Sistemas de Informação de Biodiversidade"
abstract: "Biodiversity research requires correlations of data on living beings and their habitats. Such correlations can be of different types, considering factors such as spatial relationships or environmental descriptions (e.g., description of habitat and ecossystems). Biodiversity information systems are complex pieces of software that allow researchers to perform these kinds of analysis. The complexity of these systems varies with the data used, the target users, and the environment where the systems are executed. One of the problems to be faced, especially on the Web, is the heterogeneity of the data aggravated by the diversity of user vocabularies. This research contributes to solve this problem by presenting a database model that organizes the biodiversity information using consensual data standards. The proposed model combines information collected in the field with that from museum data catalogues. The model was specified with the assistance of biologists and ecologists. The database was encapsulated in a Web service to ensure transparency in using, accessing and recovering the information. The service is invoked by client applications. The database and service were tested and validated using real data, provided by the BioCore project partners. BioCore is a research project that involves computer and biology researchers from UNICAMP and USP."
