title: "A Computational Environment for Modeling Environmental Applications"
abstract: "Geographic applications are intrinsically complex due to the nature of the data manipulated and also due to the processes acting over these data. Today, many of these applciations are built on top of a GIS (Geographic Information SYstem), a software that provides efficient storage, analysis and presentation tools for spatial data. Nevertheless, GISs present limitatinos that prevent users from taking full advantage of available GIS tools. These limitatins are mainly related to their interface and modeling features and also to the fact that end-users are experts in their application domain but do not have the adequate background in software engineering or database design. This thesis is a contribution to solve these two limitations, presenting UAPE - an environment for modeling and designing geographic applictations. With the environment, users will be able to design appications according to their needs, abstracting the implementation details related to the underlying GIS. The major contributions are: (a) an object-oriented model, GMOD, which supports both data and process modeling, (b) a methodology for environmental application design, and (c) and environment, UAPE, that integrates model and methodology in order to help users in environmental application modeling and design."
