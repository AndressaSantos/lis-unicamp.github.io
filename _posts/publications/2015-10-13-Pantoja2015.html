title: "Semantic Interpretation of Biological Identification Keys"
abstract: "In biological data, Identification Keys (IKs) are central artifacts used by biologists to identify the taxonomic group of an observed specimen, such as family, order, species, etc. Despite their relevance, IKs are usually defined in a semistructured textual format, which does not favor easily retrieval and deep analysis over their data. This article aims to present a method to formally structure and extract semantic facts from IKs relying on graphs and domain ontologies. The approach explores classical extraction and matching procedures combined with the specific characteristics of IKs. Initial experiments reveal the feasibility of the approach."
