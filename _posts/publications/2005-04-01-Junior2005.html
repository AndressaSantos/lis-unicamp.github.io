title: "Mechanisms to Speed up Foreign Trade Processes"
abstract: "The dynamism of foreign trade, a consequence of the globalization of the economy, has resulted in considerable growht of goods exchanged all over the world. In order to cope with this demand, the Brazilian government has been continuously investing in the modernization of the installations, equipment and software to offer efficient, safe and faster services to people and enterprises involved in foreign trade. The Integrated System of Foreign Trade - SISCOMEX - was developed as part of this effort. This system, developed by the agencies that control foreign trade, is responsible for controlling and storing all related information regarding Importations and Exportations, as well as Special Customers Trade. The system facilitates the supervisory tasks of the IRS, thus speeding up importation and exportation of goods in ports and airports. The systemś DBMS is hosted by a mainframe platform in SERPRO. However, data communication is done via MDB files exchanged with companies which are connected to the system through links. Every company interested in foreign trade needs to interact with SISCOMEX. This interaction is complicated because companies and government do not always have database compatibility. The dissertation covers the problems of integration and communication between companies and SISCOMEX. The main contributions are: the analysis of the interaction among the participating information systems; a proposal to standardize the most common foreign trade processes, according to processing requirements and interface standards. The model is validated through a real life case study and prototype."
