title: "Data Quality in Geographic Applications"
abstract: "One of the main goals of GIS is to help decision makers in carrying out their tasks for situations where the spatial dimension is relevant -- e.g., in urban or environmental planning activities. The quality of the decisions, however, is intimately dependent on the quality of the geographical data used. This is usually ignored by decision makers, who limit themselves to relying on the correct operation of the equipment used to collect data or on the GIS where the applications are developed. The goal of this dissertation is to fill this gap, by presenting an analysis of the theme data quality in the context of geographic applications. This analysis ranges from the stage of data capture to the presentation of the result of the applications and the interpretation taken by the user for decision making. Besides an extensive bibliographic survey, other contributions of this work include the suggestion of a basic group of criteria to evaluate this quality, and an analysis of how these criteria can be met. Finally, part of these suggestions were implemented in a tool coupled to a GIS, which allows users to visualize data quality information."
