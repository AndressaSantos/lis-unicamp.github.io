title: "Active Database System Support for Topological Constraints in Geographical Information Systems"
abstract: "This dissertation concerns the use of active databases in geographic applications. The results presented here extend the active database systems paradigm to solve the problem of maintaining spatial (topological) constraints. The solution for this problem is divided in three steps: i) topological constraint specification; ii) translation of the constraint into rules; and iii) automatic constraint maintenance, using the generated rules. This approach was used in the development of an active system prototype that incorporates an object-oriented geographic model, thus removing the gap between GIS and rule systems. The main contributions presented are a detailed study about binary topological relationships; a complete proposal for the problem of maintaining these relationships; and the definition of algorithms to verify the topological integrity (these algorithms are incorporated in the prototype)."
