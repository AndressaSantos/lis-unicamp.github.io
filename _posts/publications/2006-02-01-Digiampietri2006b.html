title: "A framework based on semantic Web services and AI planning for the management of bioinformatics scientific workflows"
abstract: "Bioinformatics activities are growing all over the world, with proliferation of data and tools. This brings new challenges, such as how to understand and organize these resources, how to exchange and reuse successful experimental procedures, tools and data, and how to provide interoperability among data and tools across different sites, and for distinct user profiles. This paper describes an effort towards these directions. It is based on combining research on databases, AI and scientific workflows, on the Semantic Web, to design, reuse, annotate and document bioinformatics experiments or parts thereof. The resulting framework allows the integration of heterogeneous data and tools, and the design of experiments as scientific workflows, which are stored in databases. Moreover, it takes advantage of the notion of planning in AI to support automatic or interactive composition of tasks. These ideas are being implemented in a prototype and validated on real bioinformatics data."
