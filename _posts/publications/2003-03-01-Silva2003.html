title: "An Architecture based on Predicate Generation for derivation of Spatial Association Rules"
abstract: "This thesis proposes and develops models and techniques for the obtention of spa tial association rules. This is based on a two-step process. In the first stage, the geographic database is preprocessed using a knowledge base specified by an expert user to indicate the relationships of interest. This produces a file where data are organized in terms of conventional and spatial predicates. This file can next be processed by standard data mining algorithm s. This simplifies the process of deriving spatial rules to a classical problem of applying traditional association rule mining algorithms. The first step uses two proposed models. The first is the Model of Relational Derivation, whose goal is to identify conventional predicates based on the analysis of descriptive attributes. The second is the Model of Spatial Derivation, responsible for checking spatial relationships among objects and generating spatial predicates, to be subsequently used to derive spatial association rules. A subsequent denormalization algorithm combines conventional and spatial predicates into a single file, used to mine association rules. The main contributions of this work are (i) the specification and validation of a model to derive spatial predicates, (ii) the creation of an architecture that allows obtaining spatial association rules using standard relational mining algorithms (iii) the use of a knowledge base to obtain predicates which are relevant to the user and (iv) the implementation of a prototype."
