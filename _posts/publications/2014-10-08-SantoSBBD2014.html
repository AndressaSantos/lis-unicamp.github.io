abstract: "Biodiversity scientists often need to define and detect scenarios of interest from data streams delivered from meteorological sensors. For example, scenarios such deforestation or forest fire need to be detected in order to reduce impacts over the environment. Such data streams are characterized by their heterogeneity across spatial and temporal scales, which hampers detection of events and construction of scenarios. To help scientists in this task, this work proposes the use of the theory of Complex Event Processing (CEP) to define and detect complex event patterns in this context. The two main contributions focus on the specification of events and patterns for the biodiversity context and on the mechanism to detect these patterns. The first one requires to extend an Event Processing Language (EPL) to include spatial relationships in the pattern. The second one will extend Koga’s framework [Koga 2013], which integrates heterogeneous data sources, with the detection of complex patterns. This paper extends the short paper accepted for the Brazilian Workshop e-Science (BreSci) 2014 with the specification for events and patterns."
