title: "Aondê: Um Serviço Web de Ontologias para Interoperabilidade em Sistemas de Biodiversidade (Aondê: An Ontology Web Service for Interoperability across Biodiversity Information Systems)"
abstract: "Biodiversity research requires associating data about living beings and their habitats, constructing sophisticated models and correlating all kinds of information. Data handled are inherently heterogeneous, being provided by distinct (and distributed) research groups, which collect these data using different vocabularies, assumptions, methodologies and goals, and under varying spatio-temporal frames. This poses many kinds of challenges in Computer Science research, from the physical (e.g., diversity of storage structures) to the conceptual level (e.g., diversity of perspectives and of knowledge domains). The adoption of ontologies has been proposed as a means to help solve heterogeneity issues. However, this kind of solution gives birth to new research issues, since it implies handling problems in ontology design, management and sharing. This dissertation presents a new kind of Web Service whose goal is to help in solving such issues. Aondê (which means ̈owl̈ in Tupi, the main branch of native Brazilian languages) is a Web Service that provides a wide range of operations for storage, management, search, ranking, analysis and integration of ontologies. The text covers the specification and implementation of Aondê, which have been validated by a prototype tested with large ontologies and real biodiversity case studies."
