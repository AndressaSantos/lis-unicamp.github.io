title: "Using hypermedia models in digital libraries for geographic data"
abstract: "This dissertation presents a model and a methodology for the construction of digital libraries. A digital library was here considered to be a hypermedia application, based on a Object Oriented Hypermedia DBMS environment. Model and methodology were used to model a specific application -- a Geographic Digital Library, whose goal is to collect and provide access to a large volume of geographic and conventional data. The construction of this library demanded the definition of a special set of metadata, which aggregates several existing standards. The geographic digital library contemplates two modes of interaction: browsing (in the traditional sense) and querying (supported by the underlying DBMS). The model integrates the OOHDM database model of Milet et al, with the Extended Dexter model, and applies extensions to this integration. The methodology extends the proposal of OODHM, adapting it to allow modelling of digital libraries. The main contributions of the dissertation are: (a) A detailed survey of requirements of digital libraries, and of hipermedia data and authoring models, presented in a unified taxonomy; (b) An object oriented hipermedia model for digital libraries; (c) A methodology which uses the model for construction of such libraries; and (d) Detailed specification of how to build geographic digital libraries, using model and methodology."
