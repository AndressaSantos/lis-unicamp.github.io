booktitle: "Chapter II in the book: Spatial Databases: Technologies, Techniques and Trends"
title: "Integrating Web Data and Geographic Knowledge into Spatial Databases"
abstract: "Spatial database systems has been an active area of research over the past 20 years. A large number of research efforts have appeared in literature aimed at effective modelling of spatial data and efficient processing of spatial queries. This book investigates several aspects of a spatial database system, and includes recent research efforts in this field. More specifically, some of the topics covered are: spatial data modelling; indexing of spatial and spatio-temporal objects; data mining and knowledge discovery in spatial and spatio-temporal databases; management issues; and query processing for moving objects. Therefore, the reader will be able to get in touch with several important issues that the research community is dealing with. Moreover, each chapter is self-contained, and it is easy for the non-specialist to grasp the main issues. The authors of the book’s chapters are well-known researchers in spatial databases, and have offered significant contributions to spatial database literature. The chapters of this book provide an in-depth study of current technologies, techniques and trends in spatial and spatio-temporal database systems research. Each chapter has been carefully prepared by the contributing authors, in order to conform with the book’s requirements."
