title: "An Infrastructure to Support Choreographies in Interorganizational Business Processes"
abstract: "The main attractiveness of Web services is their capacity to provide interoperability among heterogeneous distributed systems. Increasingly, companies and organizations have adopted Web services as a way to interoperate with their business partners. In such a scenario, Web services choreography can be applied in the specification of interorganizational business processes. However, the dynamic nature of business partnerships requires mechanisms for agile designing and deploying of choreographies. In this paper, we present an infrastructure that aims to address the above concern. Our approach, which is based on WS-CDL, BPEL, and UDDI standards, aims to reach flexibility by providing mechanisms for sharing, finding and executing choreographies in a friendly manner for the user. We also present a prototype implementation and its application in a supply chain integration system."
