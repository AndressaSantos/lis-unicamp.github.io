booktitle: "Proceedings of the Satellite Events of the 31st Brazilian Symposium on Databases (Thesis and Dissertations Workshop)"
title: "Provenance-Based Infrastructure to Support Reuse of Computational Experiments"
abstract: "One recurrent problem in multidisciplinary research is finding reusable objects (e.g., scripts, code, documents, workflows) that can be used across disciplines to enhance collaboration.
This paper presents our ongoing work taking advantage of provenance information, combined with scientific workflows, to help find such objects. We also present challenges posed by provenance-based retrieval, which we propose as a solution for transdisciplinary scientific collaboration via reuse.
Our case study in molecular dynamics experiments is part of a larger multi-scale experimental scenario that requires cooperation involving scientists from different disciplines."
