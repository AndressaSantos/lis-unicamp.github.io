title: "Maintenance of Binary Topological Constraints through Active Databases"
abstract: "This paper presents a system developed at UNICAMP for automatically maintaining topological constraints in a geographic database. This system is based on extending to spatial data the notion of standard integrity maintenance through active databases. Topological relations, defined by the user, are transformed into spatial integrity constraints, which are stored in the database as production rules. These rules are used to maintain the corresponding set of topological relations, for all applications that use the database. This extends previous work on rules and gis by incorporating the rules into the DBMS rather than having them handled by a separate module."
