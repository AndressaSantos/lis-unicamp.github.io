title: "Quality Flow: a collaborative quality-aware platform for experiments in eScience"
abstract: "Many scientific research procedures rely upon the analysis of data obtained from heterogeneous sources. The validity of the research results depends, among others, on the quality of data. Data quality is a topic that has pervaded computer science research for decades. Though there are many proposals for data quality assessment, there are still open problems such as mechanisms to support flexible quality assessment and ways to derive data quality. The goal of this dissertation is to work on these issues. The main contribution of this dissertation is the proposal of QualityFlow: a quality-aware collaborative platform for experiments in eScience. The following contributions were accomplished: to support the creation of quality-aware scientific workflows, allowing the addition of quality attributes to workflows, while at the same time letting distinct users define their specific quality metrics for the same workflow; to allow users to keep track of different quality assessments for a given process, thereby providing insights into the actual value of data and workflow; and to allow scientists to customize data quality dimensions and quality metrics collaboratively. QualityFlow was developed as a web prototype, and executed in two experiments - one based upon a real problem and the other on a sample workflow."
