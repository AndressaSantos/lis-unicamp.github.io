title: "DNS-based Load Balancing for Web Services"
abstract: "A key issue for good performance of geographically replicated web services is the efficiency of the load balancing mechanism used to distribute client requests among the replicas. This work revisits the research on DNS-based load balancing mechanisms considering a SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) scenario. In this kind of load balancing solution the Authoritative DNS (ADNS) of the distributed web service performs the role of the client request scheduler, redirecting the clients to one of the server replicas, according to some load distribution policy. This paper proposes a new policy that combines client load information and server load information in order to reduce the negative effects of the DNS caching on the load balancing. We also present the results obtained through an experimental tesbed built on basis of the TPC-W benchmark"
