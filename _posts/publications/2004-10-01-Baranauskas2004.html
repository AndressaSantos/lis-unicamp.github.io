abstract: "Geographical Information Systems (GIS) allow the manipulation, management and visualization of georeferenced data. The interest GIS applications has increased in the last years. Currently, Web GIS applications make available through the Internet geographic information dispersed in different places. There are several categories of GIS applications, in different scales and application domains, ranging from urban application to environmental problems. The importance of Web GIS for the agricultural domain comes from the fact that they function as a useful tool for users who work direct or indirectly in the agricultural domain: agriculturists, cooperatives, government instances. Considering the strategic value of these systems and the wide range of different prospective users, this work presents a survey of Web GIS applications with emphasis in the agricultural domain, and investigates user-system interaction aspects in these applications."
