title: "Implementing a Metadata Database for an Environmental Information System"
abstract: "This paper presents the modeling and implementation aspects of a metadata database for the information system of the BIOTA/FAPESP research program. This program's goal is the cooperation among biodiversity researchers in the State of Sao Paulo, Brazil, thus helping to maintain and create environmental protection programs within the Stat e. The information system, under development, shall integrate data from the different research groups and foster the dissemination of their work. This information system is unique in several aspects, including the diversity of data managed, and the spectrum of users. The metadata database is the system's component responsible for the high level description of the various biodiversity data gathered by the researchers. This paper concentrates on the metadata standard developed for this information system, and on the database implementation aspects."
