title: "Accessibility as a quality requirement: geographic information systems on the web"
abstract: "Web applications enable users with different profiles and necessities to access information from diversified locations and with different access tools. Besides the aspects that have already been discussed in works from the Software Quality domain, the accessibility to information and the Internet flexibility have been considered more and more important. Thus, considering accessibility as an important quality attribute for Web applications, in this paper we investigate the subject considering the context of Geographic Information Systems on the Web. Preliminary results of accessibility evaluation on some WebGIS applications show that this domain presents several challenges to be coped with in the design of their user interfaces."
