title: "BioGraph: Linking Biological Bases Across Organisms"
abstract: "Representing data as networks have been shown to be a powerful approach for data analysis in biodiversity, e.g., interactions among organisms; relations among genes and phenotypes etc. In this context, databases and repositories following a graph model (e.g., RDF) have been increasingly used to interconnect information and to support network-driven analysis. Usually, this kind of analysis requires gathering together and linking data from several distinct and heterogeneous sources. In this work, we investigate this challenge in the context of biological bases focusing on the characterization of living organisms, especially their phenotypes and diseases. It includes the rich diversity of Model Organism Databases (MODs) -- repositories specialized in a particular taxon -- widely used in the biological and medical studies. We exploit a lightweight integration approach, inspired in the Linked Open Data initiative, mapping several biological bases in a unified graph database -- our BioGraph -- and linking key elements to offer an interconnected view over the data. We present here practical experiments to validate the proposal and to show how BioGraph can contribute for biological data analysis in a network perspective."
