title: "A Methodology to Integrate Legacy Systems and Heterogeneous Databases"
abstract: "Applications increasingly need to access different data sources to get information. Many of these sources are managed by legacy systems, and need to be integrated or migrated to become more flexible and manageable. This work proposes a methodology to help the integration of these heterogeneous data sources and which takes legacy data into account, considering the features of each system. The methodology takes into account several factors that help the choice of the better solution to be applied on each case, and an algorithm to design the federated system and to process queries using this system. The proposed methodology was validated by a case study on databases and legacy systems for a municipal administration system for the city of Paulinia, SP."
