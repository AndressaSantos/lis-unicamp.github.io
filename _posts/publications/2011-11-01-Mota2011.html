title: "Using linked data to extract geo-knowledge"
abstract: "There are several approaches to extract geo-knowledge from documents and textual fields in databases. Most of them focus on detecting geographic evidence, from which the associated geographic location can be determined. This paper is based on a different premise -- geo-knowledge can be extracted even from non-geographic evidence, taking advantage of the linked data paradigm. The paper gives an overview of our approach and presents two case studies to extract geo-knowledge from documents and databases in the biodiversity domain."
