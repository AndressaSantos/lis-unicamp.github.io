title: "Sinimbu - Multimodal queries to support biodiversity studies"
abstract: "Typical biodiversity information systems can only solve a small part of user concerns. Available query mechanisms are based on traditional textual database manipulations, combmining them with spatial correlations. However, experts need more complex computations – e.g., using non-textual data sources. This involves a considerable amount of manual tasks, to obtain the needed information. This paper presents the specification and implementation of Sinimbu – a framework to process multimodal queries that support both text and images as search parameters, for biodiversity studies, thus providing support for subsequent complex simulations. Sinimbu was validated with real data from our university’s Zoology Museum, which houses one of the largest zoological museum collections in Brazil. Not only can users interact with the system in several modes, but query possibilities (and answers) vary according to the user’s profile. Query processing in Sinimbu combines work in database management, image processing and ontology construction and management."
