title: "An ontology-based framework for bioinformatics workflows"
abstract: "Bioinformatics activities are growing all over the world, with proliferation of data and tools. This brings new challenges, such as how to understand and organize these resources, how to exchange and reuse successful experimental procedures, tools and data, and how to provide interoperability among data and tools across different sites, and for distinct user profiles. This paper describes an effort toward these directions. It is based on combining research on ontology management, AI and scientific workflows, on the Semantic Web, to design, reuse, annotate and document bioinformatics experiments. The resulting framework takes advantage of ontologies to support the specification and annotation of bioinformatics workflows, and to serve as the basis for tracking data provenance. Moreover, it uses AI planning techniques to support automatic or interactive composition of tasks. These ideas have been implemented in a prototype and validated on real bioinformatics data."
