title: "Integrating Heuristics and Spatial Databases - a case study"
abstract: "This paper presents part of the ongoing efforts at ic­unicamp to apply heuristic algorithms to vectorial georeferenced data in order to help decision support in urban planning. The results reported are original in the sense that they combine recent re­ search in both combinatorial algorithm development and geographic databases, using them in the solution of a practical problem. A first prototype, described in the paper, has already been developed and tested against real data on the city of Campinas, to support planning activities for the São Paulo State Post Office System, Brazil."
