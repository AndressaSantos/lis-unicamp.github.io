title: "Design de interação em sistemas computacionais para apoio à aprendizagem ativa: uma abordagem sistêmica"
abstract: "In formal learning contexts, there is a diversity of interests and skills than need to have space in the interaction between those involved in the production and sharing of knowledge. Active Learning refers to a set of strategies through which the participation of key actors in the educational environment goes beyond the unidirectional expository/receptive model of knowledge, involving activities where discussion and collaboration with others have an important role in reflection and construction of meaning. Computer systems that support the learning processes have not been designed for the diversity of skills and demands present in such environments. In this thesis we argue that if we want to develop solutions that make sense to stakeholders and suited to the complexity that characterizes Active Learning scenarios, we need to include them in the design cycle. In this paper we adopt a perspective based on Organizational Semiotics for analysis of Active Learning scenarios and propose a systemic vision for the interaction design in such environments, including motivational aspects. Work results include: a cyclical design process than we call 'on the fly design', and a system for collaborative authoring and review of Active Learning activities. This process has been experimented on incremental construction of the system which, in turn, has been experimented in a real context of higher education. The system was evaluated iteratively, based on feedback from stakeholders in the situated context, feeding back the characterization of the process. The process was effective in building an emerging system for supporting the collaboration and participation of those involved in the experimented Active Learning scenarios."
