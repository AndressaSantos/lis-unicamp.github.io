title: "SciFrame: a conceptual framework to describe data sharing in e-Science"
abstract: "The first SBC Challenge aims to provide solutions to the problem of managing large volumes of multimedia data. Our goal is to contribute towards research in these directions by discussing the problems involved in sharing scientific digital information. First, we propose a conceptual framework (SciFrame) that helps to understand the main issues involved and to integrate related research efforts. Second, we use a real case study to point out problems which are particular to scientific data management. Finally, we describe our case study using SciFrame."
