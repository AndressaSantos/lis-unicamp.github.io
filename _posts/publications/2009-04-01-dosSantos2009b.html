title: "Using Relevance Feedback for Classifying Remote Sensing Images"
abstract: "This paper presents an interactive technique for remote sensing image classification. In our proposal, users are able to interact with the classification system, indicating regions which are of interest. Furthermore, a genetic programming approach is used to learn user preferences and combine image region descriptors that encode spectral and texture properties. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective and suitable for image classification tasks."
