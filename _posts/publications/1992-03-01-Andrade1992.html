title: "Integrity Constraints Maintenance in Object-Oriented Databases"
abstract: "This thesis analyses the problem of static integrity constraints in object oriented database systems, using production rules and the paradigm of active databases. This work shows how to automatically change constraints into production rules, based on information from the constraints and the DBMS schema. The algorithm for rule generation was implemented, and can be used not only for constraint maintenance in object oriented database systems, but also for relational and nested database systems, being of general use. The research developed here includes the specification of a taxonomy for constraints in object oriented systems which considerates their dynamic dimension, and the definition and implementation of a language for constraint specification to facilitate their processing. This work extends proposals of other authors, implementing support for constraints, not only about data, but also about methods."
