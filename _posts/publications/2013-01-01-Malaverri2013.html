title: "A Provenance-based Approach to Evaluate Data Quality in eScience"
abstract: "Data quality is growing in relevance as a research topic. This is becoming increasingly crucial in data-intensive domains, e.g., stock market and financial studies, eHealth, or environmental research. Indeed, the data deluge characteristic of eScience applications has brought about new concerns along this direction. Quality assessment methods and models have been progressively incorporated in many business environments, as well as in software engineering practices. eScience environments, however, because of the many data source providers, kinds of scientific expertise needed, and multiple timeand- space scales involved in a given problem make it diffcult to assess data quality. This paper is concerned with the evaluation of the quality of data managed by eScience applications. Our approach is based on data provenance, i.e. the history of the origins and transformation processes applied to a given data product. Our contributions include: (i) the specification of a framework to track data provenance and use this information to derive quality information; (ii) a model for data provenance based on the Open Provenance Model; and (iii) a methodology to evaluate the quality of some digital artifact based on its provenance. Our proposal is validated experimentally by a prototype we developed that takes advantage of the Taverna work ow system."
