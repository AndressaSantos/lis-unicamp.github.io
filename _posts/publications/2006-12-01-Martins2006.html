title: "A Proposal for the Database of the WebMaps Project"
abstract: "The goal of the WebMaps project is the specification and development of a WEB information system to support crop planning and monitoring in Brazil. This kind of project involves state-of-the art research all over the world. One of the problems faced by WebMaps is database design. This work attacks this issue, discussing the project´s needs and proposing a basic database that supports management of users, properties and parcels, as well as other kinds of data, especially satellite images. The main contributions of this work are: specification of a spatio-temporal database model; specification of sets of temporal, spatial and spatio-temporal queries; and the implementation of a prototype, in Postgresql/Postgis."
