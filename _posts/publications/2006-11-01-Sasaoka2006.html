booktitle: "Proc 3rd International Workshop on Conceptual Modeling for Geographic Information Systems (CoMoGIS2006)"
title: "Access Control in Geographic Databases."
abstract: "The problem of access control in databases consists of determining when (and if) users or applications can access stored data, and what kind of access they are allowed. This paper discusses this problem for geographic databases, where constraints imposed on access control management must consider the spatial location context. The model and solution provided are motivated by problems found in AM/FM applications developed in the management of telephone infrastructure in Brazil, in a real life situation."
