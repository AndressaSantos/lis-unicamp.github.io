title: "TSD: A Shape Descriptor based on a Distribution of Tensor Scale Local Orientation."
abstract: "We present tensor scale descriptor (TSD)--- a shape descriptor for content-based image retrieval, registration, and analysis. TSD exploits the notion of local structure thickness, orientation, and anisotropy as represented by the largest ellipse centered at each image pixel and within the same homogeneous region. The proposed method uses the normalized histogram of the local orientation (the angle of the ellipse) at regions of high anisotropy and thickness within a certain interval. It is shown that TSD is invariant to rotation and to some reasonable level of scale changes. Experimental results with a fish database are presented to illustrate and validate the method."
