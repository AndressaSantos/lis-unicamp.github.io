title: "Handling Provenance in Biodiversity"
abstract: "One of the concerns in eScience research is the design and development of novel solutions to support distributed collaboration. In this context, regardless of the scientific domain, an important problem is the reproducibility of the results from scientific activities, considering the heterogeneous data involved and the specific research context. This paper presents a proposal to help solve this problem, proposing a software architecture to handle provenance issues."
