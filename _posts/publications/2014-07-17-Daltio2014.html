title: "Handling Multiple Foci in Graph Databases"
editor: "Springer International Publishing Switzerland"
abstract: "Scientific research has become data-intensive and data-dependent, with distributed, multidisciplinary, teams creating and sharing their findings. Graph databases are being increasingly considered as a computational means to loosely integrate such data, in particular when relationships among data and the data itself are at the same importance level. However, a problem to be faced in this context is that of multiple foci – where a focus, here, is a perspective on the data, for a particular research team and context. This paper describes a conceptual framework for the construction of arbitrary foci on graph databases, to help solve this problem. The framework, under construction, is illustrated using examples based on needs of teams involved in biodiversity research."
