abstract: "Web GIS applications have received marked attention in the last years, since geographic information can be visualizated/manipulated in different places, for different profiles of users, using the Internet. This increases the complexity implementation of GIS applications, both with regard to functional aspects, and in computer-human interface aspects. The goal of this work is to illustrate the concept and techniques of usability in the context of interfaces for Web GIS applications, by means of a case study of usability test for these applications."
