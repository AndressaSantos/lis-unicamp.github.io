title: "Use of Urban Geographic Data in the Comparison of Spatial Access Methods"
abstract: "This dissertation presents a performance analysis of spatial access methods based on a real life database. In spite of the large amount of research dealing with the performance comparison of spatial access methods, very little has been done when it comes to considering the properties of specific groups of applications. In part, this is due to the difficulty in obtaining real data sets to represent these applications. The use of real data is necessary, since synthetic data generation may result in data sets with atypical characteristics, leading in turn to conclusions that may not be generally applied. In this context, the main contributions of this work are: - the conversion of a real data set that is representative of geographic applica tions for public utility services management to a format in which it may be easily delivered to other researchers. Public utility services include telecommunica tion, electricity and water supply, and the like. - the performance comparison of a group of spatial access methods of the R-tree family with regard to the indexing of these data."
