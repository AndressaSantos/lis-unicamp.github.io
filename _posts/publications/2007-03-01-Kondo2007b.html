title: "Traceability in Food for Supply Chains."
abstract: "Supply Chains present many research challenges in Computing, such as the modeling of theirs processes, communication problems between theirs components, logistics and processes management. This paper presents a supply chain traceability model that relies on a Web service-based architecture to ensure interoperability. Geared towards assisting quality control in the agricultural domain, the model allows to trace products, processes and services inside chain. The model has been validated for real life case studies and theWeb service implementation is under way."
