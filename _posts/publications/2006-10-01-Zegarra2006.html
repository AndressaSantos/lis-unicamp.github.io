abstract: "Two kinds of fingerprint identification approaches have been proposed in the literature to reduce the number of one-to-many comparisons during fingerprint image retrieval, namely, exclusive and continuous classification. Although exclusive classification approaches reduce the number of comparisons, they present some shortcomings, including fingerprint ambiguous classification, and unbalanced fingerprint classification distribution. On the other side, continuous classification approaches have not been further studied. In this context, we propose an original continuous approach to guide the search and the retrieval in fingerprint image databases considering both effectiveness and retrieval speed. For that purposes, we use feature extraction and indexing methods considering the textural and directional information contained in fingerprint images. Preliminary results of our work involves a comparative study of several textural image descriptors obtained by combining different types of the Wavelet Transform with similarity measures. From our experiments we can conclude that the best retrieval accuracy was achieved by combining Gabor Wavelets (GWs) with the Square Chord similarity measure. Furthermore, the presence of noise and distortions in fingerprint images have affected the overall retrieval accuracy."
