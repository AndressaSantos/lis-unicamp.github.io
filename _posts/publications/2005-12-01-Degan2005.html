title: "Corporate data integration: proposal of an architecture based on data services"
abstract: "The need for data integration in enterprises dates back to several decades. However, it is still a pressing problem for most environments, since it is seen as a means to allow integration among customers, partners and suppliers. Besides needs that arise from fusion of companies, there is always the issue of legacy systems that result from distinct implementations in different technologies. The resulting scenario is a distributed set of files and databases, which are redundant heterogeneous and hard to manage. Data integration requires reliable mechanisms, as well as an integrated set of procedures to ensure consistency, security and control of corporate data. Off the shelf solutions still provide fragmented views of data integration. This work analyzes problems found in enterprises during data integration processes, taking all previously mentioned factors into consideration. It proposes an architecture to solve these problems. The solution combines research in databases, distributed systems, and Web services and systems."
