title: "Managing sensor traffic data and forecasting unusual behaviour propagation"
abstract: "Sensor data on traffic events have prompted a wide range of research issues, related
with the so-called ITS (Intelligent Transportation Systems). Data are delivered for
both static (fixed) and mobile (embedded) sensors, generating large and complex spatiotemporal series. This scenario presents several research challenges, in spatio-temporal data management and data analysis. Management issues involve, for instance, data cleaning and data fusion to support queries at distinct spatial and temporal granularities. Analysis issues
include the characterization of traffic behavior for given space and/or time windows, and
detection of anomalous behavior (either due to sensor malfunction, or to traffic events).

This paper contributes to the solution of some of these issues through a new kind of
framework to manage static sensor data. Our work is based on combining research on analytical methods to process sensor data, and data management strategies to query these data. The first component is geared towards supporting pattern matching. This leads to a model to study and predict unusual traffic behavior along an urban road network. The second component deals with spatio-temporal database issues, taking into account information produced by the model. This allows distinct granularities and modalities of analysis of sensor data in space and time. This work was conducted within a project that uses real data, with tests
conducted on 1000 sensors, during 3 years, in a large French city."
