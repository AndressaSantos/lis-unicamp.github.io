title: "Searching Time Series via Semantic Annotations"
abstract: "Time series are used in several domains of knowledge. During their analysis, experts often create or analyze associations between time series and annotations. In order to study a problem, for example, patient behavior or crop patterns, experts need to search and correlate several time series. However, finding appropriate series related with a problem is a difficult task. Search is usually performed using a few parameters, such as series geographic location. Annotations may be used to help the search using string match. Given this scenario, this paper discusses a work in progress to design and partially develop a software framework to search time series via semantic annotations. It will support experts in the correlation of time series, foster collaboration among experts, and allow the use of Linked Data concepts to aggregate knowledge to content. This paper extends the short paper accepted for BRESCI - Brazilian Workshop e-Science 2014. The extensions include a time series semantic annotation model, implementation details, and a longer theoretical related work section."
