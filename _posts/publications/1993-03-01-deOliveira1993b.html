title: "A Graphical Tool for Browse and Query in Object-Oriented Databases"
abstract: "This dissertation analyses the problems involved in the design and implementation of graphical interfaces for object-oriented database management systems (DBMSs). As a result of this analysis, the dissertation presents directives for the development of database system interfaces. The practical application of these directives was illustrated through the specification and implementation of GOODIES -- a new interface system, which allows browsing and querying DBMSs that support the basic features of the OO model. The design and implementation of this new system is described as a case study of the use of the proposed directives. The system development process was purposely conducted independent from any specific DBMS. Thus, it can be used on top of several OO database systems."
