title: "Automatic Generation of Workflow Provenance"
abstract: "While workflow is playing an increasingly important role in e-Science, current systems lack support for the collection of provenance data. We argue that workflow provenance data should be automatically generated by the enactment engine and managed over time by an underlying storage service. We briefly describe our layered model for workflow execution provenance, which allows navigation from the conceptual model of an experiment to instance data collected during a specific experiment run, and back."
