title: "Metadata for Scientific Workflows to support Environmental Planning"
abstract: "Environmental Planning Activities have received great attention in the last years, in response to factors that include the acceleration in population growth and consequent necessity of rational exploration of natural resources. The problems in this domain are complex and the goals may often conflict, demanding cooperation of many kinds of experts from several application domains. The WOODSS (Workflow-based Spatial Decision Support System) system, developed in UNICAMPś Institute of Computing, provides support to environmental planning activities, documenting them by scientific workflows, stored in a database. The focus of this dissertation is the specification of efficient means for managing these workflows. The solution is based on the use of metadata specific to scientific workflows. This solution allows flexible access to environmental plans, using distinct sets of parameters, thereby helping communication among the experts involved, as well as plan maintenance, reuse and evolution. The main contributions of this dissertation are: (1) survey of requirements for documenting environmental planning activities; (2) Proposal of a metadata standard for workflows which document Environmental Planning Activities; (3) Specification of mechanisms to couple this standard to WOODSS; and (4) Partial implementation of the proposal, geared towards system extensibility."
