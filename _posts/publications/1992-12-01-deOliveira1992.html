title: "Browsing and Querying Object-Oriented Databases"
abstract: "We present a new interface for Object-Oriented Database Management Systems (OODBMSs). The GOODIES system (an acronym for Graphical Object Oriented Database Interface with Extended Synchronism) combines and expands the functions of many existing interface systems, introducing some new concepts for improved browsing in an OODBMS. The implementation of GOODIES proposes a new approach to database interfaces development: instead of being strongly dependent of the underlying DBMS, GOODIES is based on the main features of the object-oriented data model. The system design is based on an internal model and on an external model. The internal model ,defines the relationships that bind the interface to the DBMS. The external model determines the possible interaction between the user and the interface system. This paper describes the concepts of the external model of the GOODIES system."
