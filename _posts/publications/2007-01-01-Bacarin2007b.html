title: "Using choreography to support collaboration in agricultural supply chains"
abstract: "This paper presents an approach to support choreography in agricultural supply chains. It depicts a model for this kind of chain that considers both static and dynamic aspects, and their mapping to an underlying architecture. In particular, the model emphasizes mutual agreements, coordination of activities, quality enforcement and activity documentation. The architecture is centered on mapping chain elements to Web Services and their dynamics to the choreography of services. A case study, for soy supply chains, is used to motivate the approach."
