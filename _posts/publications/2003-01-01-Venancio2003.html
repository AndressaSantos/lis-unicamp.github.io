title: "Applying Geographic Object Ontologies to help Navigation in GIS"
abstract: "The Semantic Web has become an active research area with many promising applications. This paper gives a concrete contribution to the adoption of Semantic Web technology in GIS, by describing the use of a domain ontology to help navigation on maps, and support the integration of geographic objects on the Web. The OntoCarta system, which we are developing to demonstrate our methods, relies on current standards and public domain tools to build a map navigator including: (1) a viewer for maps in different scales; (2) a domain ontology to describe and correlate maps’ objects. The combination of these components results in a knowledge directed cartographic navigation system. This system supports map zooming, while keeping contextual information for different levels of abstraction. The adoption of open formats to represent the domain ontology, allied to the consensual character of this ontology, enables the use of OntoCarta on a Web browser and fosters data reuse throughout the Internet."
