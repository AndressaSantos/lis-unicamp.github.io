title: "A comparative study among pattern classifiers in interactive image segmentation"
abstract: "Edition of natural images usually asks for considerable user involvement, being segmentation one of the main challenges. This paper describes a unified graph-based framework for fast, precise and accurate interactive image segmentation. The method divides segmentation into object recognition, enhancement and extraction. Recognition is done by the user when markers are selected inside and outside the object. Enhancement increases the dissimilarities between object and background and extraction separates them. Enhancement is done by a fuzzy pixel classifier and it has a great impact in the number of markers required for extraction. In view of minimizing user involvement, we focus this paper on a comparative study among popular classifiers for enhancement, conducting experiments with several natural images and seven users."
