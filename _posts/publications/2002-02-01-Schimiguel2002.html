title: "3D GIS Application Interfaces considered as Communication Spaces"
abstract: "A Geographical Information System (GIS) is a system that deals with manipulation, administration and visualization of geo-referenced data. The term geo-referenced denotes data that possess representation in a system of geographical coordinates. A GIS allows the creation of applications for specific domains, such as urban and environmental planning. An application involves data, algorithms, functions and visualization (application interface). There are two GIS interface categories: 2DGIS and 3DGIS. In our work, we are particularly interested in the latter. 2DGIS are restricted to the 2D representation of space. 3DGIS allow the creation of interfaces for applications that raise the geographical visualization to a higher level of visual reality. Visual reality, in this context, refers to the vision that a human being has of the real world. Despite their facilities for manipulation of geographical data, GIS presuppose application designers have specific knowledge of all aspects of the technology of the system, thus restricting its use only to people involved in that domain. There is a series of conceptual problems that create a gap between a GIS and the reality noticed by application designers. These problems start with the design of the interface of those tools. This hampers the development process of 3D interfaces for GIS applications. The objective of this work is the study and evaluation of the modelling of 3D interfaces for GIS applications. A case study on ArcView GIS 3D Analyst illustrates this study. As a way of dealing with the problem, we propose the use of a specific semiotics-based methodology denominated Communication Space, for modelling 3D GIS application interfaces. Semiotics allows dealing with application interface entities as if they were elements which communicate a meaning, enabling the designer to capture inconsistencies that are important in the (re)design of the 3D interface. The adopted methodology served as a basis to develop an interface layer on ArcView GIS 3D Analyst, denominated EComSIG. The objective of EComSIG is to hide the inherent complexity of the modelling of 3D interfaces for GIS applications and, at the same time, to systematize the process of designing 3D interfaces for such applications. The contributions of the work are of two natures: (i) theoretical: providing the study of interface aspects for Geographical Information Systems, considering its semiotic aspects and (ii) applied: the development of a prototype to evaluate the relevance of the proposed solution."
