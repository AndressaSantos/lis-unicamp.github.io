title: "A Relevance Feedback Method based on Genetic Programming for Classification of Remote Sensing Images"
abstract: "This paper presents an interactive technique for remote sensing image classification. In our proposal, users are able to interact with the classification system, indicating regions of interest (and those which are not). This feedback information is employed by a genetic programming approach to learn user preferences and combine image region descriptors that encode spectral and texture properties. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is effective for image classification tasks and outperforms some recent and effective as well as traditional baselines for the problem."
