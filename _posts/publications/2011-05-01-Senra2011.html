title: "ORGANOGRAPHS Multi-faceted Hierarchical Categorization of Web Documents"
abstract: "The data deluge of information in the Web challenges internauts to organize their references to interesting content in theWeb as well as in their private storage space off-line. Having an automatically managed personal index to content acquired from theWeb is useful for everybody, but critical to researchers and scholars. In this paper, we discuss concepts and problems related to organizing information through multi-faceted hierarchical categorization. We introduce the organograph as a mechanism to specify multiple views of how content is organized. Organographs can help scientists to automatically organize their documents along multiple axes, improving sharing and navigation through themes and concepts according to a particular research objective."
