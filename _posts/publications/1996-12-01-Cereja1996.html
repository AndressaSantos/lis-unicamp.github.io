title: "Views in GIS - a model and mechanisms"
abstract: "This thesis analyses the functionality offered by view mechanisms in order to satisfy specific GIS needs. The main results presented are: (1) a detailed analysis of the role views can play in the GIS context; (2) the specification of an object oriented view model to be used in GIS, which shows the need for additional data and semantic information in order to support the required functionality; (3) the presentation of a mechanism to support the model; and (4) a language to specify views in this model. The work developed is validated through the modelling of a real world application using the model and language proposed."
