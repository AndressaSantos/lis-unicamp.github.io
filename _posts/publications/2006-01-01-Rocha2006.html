title: "Biomineralization of polyanionic collagen-elastin matrices during cavarial bone repair"
abstract: "The polyanionic collagen-elastin matrices (PCEMs) are osteoconductive scaffolds that present high biocompatibility and efficacy in the regeneration of bone defects. In this study, the objective was to determine if these matrices are directly mineralized during the osteogenesis process and their influence in the organization of the new bone extracellular matrix. Samples of three PCEMs, differing in their charge density, were implanted into critical-sized calvarial bone defects created in rats and evaluated from 3days up to 1 year after implantation. The implanted PCEMs were directly biomineralized by osteoblasts as shown by ultrastructural, histoenzymologic, and morphologic analysis. The removal of the implants occurred during the bone remodeling process. The organization of the new bone matrix was evaluated by image texture analysis determining the Shannonś entropy and the fractal dimension of digital images. The bone matrix complexity decreased as the osteogenesis progressed approaching the values obtained for the original bone structure. These results show that the PCEMs allow faster formation of new bone by direct biomineralization of its structure and skipping the biomaterial resorption phase."
