title: "Maintaining Integrity Constraints across Versions in a Database"
abstract: "This paper analyzes the problem of maintaining application-dependent integrity constraints in databases for design enviroments, Such enviroments are characterized by the need to support different types of interaction between integreity maintenance and version maintenance nechanisms. The paper describes these problems, and propose a framework in which they can be treated homogeneously. We thus bridge the gap existing between research on constraint maintenance and on version control, which has so far posed several problems to researchers in these two areas."
