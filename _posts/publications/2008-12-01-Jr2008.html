title: "Managing the lifecycle of sensor data: from production to consumption"
abstract: "Sensing devices are becoming widely disseminated, being applied in several domains, noticeably in scientific research. However, the increase in their number and variety introduces problems on managing the produced data, such as how to provide sensor data at distinct rates or temporal resolutions for different applications, or how to pre-process or format the data differently for each request. This work is concerned with tackling four issues that arise in the management of sensor data for scientific applications: (i) providing homogeneous access to heterogeneous sensing devices and their data; (ii) managing the composition of operations applied to sensor data; (iii) offering flexible data pre-processing facilities prior to sensor data publication; and, (iv) propagating and creating valid data annotations (metadata) throughout the data life cycle. The proposed solution to issue (i) is to uniformly encapsulate both software and data by extending a component technology called Digital Content Components (DCCs), also allowing associated annotations. Using these components as a basis, the proposed solution to (ii) is to apply scientific workflows to coordinate the combination of data and software DCCs. The solution proposed to (iii) involves invoking and posting workflow specifications from the data provider as well as using the annotations on DCCs to enrich the queries and answers. Finally, an annotation propagation mechanism is proposed as a solution to (iv). Our contributions arepresented within a framework for sensor data management, which unifies aspects of data access, pre-processing, publication and annotation."
