title: "A Provenance Approach to Assess the Quality of Geospatial Data"
abstract: "Geographic information is present in our daily lives. This pervasiveness is also at the origin of several problems, including heterogeneity and trustworthiness -- of the data sources, of the data providers, and of the data products derived from the original sources. Most efforts to improve this situation concentrate on establishing data collection and curation standards, and quality metadata. This paper extends these efforts by presenting an approach to assess quality of geospatial data based on provenance."
