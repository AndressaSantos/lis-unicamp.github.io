title: "Hydrograph: Exploring Geographic Data in Graph Databases"
abstract: "Water becomes, every day, more scarce. Reliable information about volume and quality in each watershed is important to management and proper planning of their use. Data-intensive science is being increasingly needed in this context. Associated analysis processes require handling the drainage network that represents a watershed. This paper presents an ongoing work that explores geographic watershed data using graph databases – a scalable and flexible kind of NoSQL databases. The Brazilian Watershed database is used as a case study. The mapping between geographic and graph models is based on the natural network that emerges from the topological relationships among geographic entities."
