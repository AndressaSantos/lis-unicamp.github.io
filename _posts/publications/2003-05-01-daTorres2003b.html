title: "A Graph-based Approach for Multiscale Shape Analysis."
abstract: "This paper presents the advantages of computing two recently proposed shape descriptors, multiscale fractal dimension and contour saliences, using the image foresting transform---a graph-based approach to the design of image processing operators. It introduces a robust approach to estimate contour saliences (peaks of high curvature) by exploiting the relation between contour and skeleton. The paper also compares both shape descriptors to fractal dimension, Fourier descriptors, and moment invariants with respect to their invariance to object characteristics that belong to a same class (compact-ability) and to their discriminatory ability to separate objects that belong to distinct classes (separability)."
