title: "Multiresolution Features for Fingerprint Image Retrieval."
abstract: "This paper presents a real time system to guide the search and the retrieval in fingerprint image databases considering both retrieval accuracy and speed. For that purposes, we use multiresolution-based feature extraction and indexing methods considering the textural information inherent to fingerprint images. The extracted feature vectors are used to compute the distance between the fingerprint query image to all the fingerprints in the database and the N most similar images are then retrieved. The focus of this work is to study the utility of multiresolution transforms on the domain of fingerprint recognition."
