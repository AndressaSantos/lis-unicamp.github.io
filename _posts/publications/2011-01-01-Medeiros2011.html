title: "Data Driven Research at LIS: the Laboratory of Information Systems at UNICAMP"
abstract: "This article presents an overview of the research conducted at the Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS) at the Institute of Computing, UNICAMP. Its creation, in 1994, was motivated by the need to support data-driven research within multidisciplinary projects involving computer scientists and scientists from other fields. Throughout the years, it has housed projects in many domains - in agriculture, biodiversity, medicine, health, bioinformatics, urban planning, telecommunications, and sports - with scientific results in these fields and in Computer Science, with emphasis in data management, integrating research on databases, image processing, human-computer interfaces, software engineering and computer networks. The research produced 14 PhD theses, 70 MSc dissertations, 40$+$ journal papers and 200$+$ conference papers, having been assisted by over 80 undergraduate student scholarships. Several of these results were obtained through cooperation with many Brazilian universities and research centers, as well as groups in Canada, USA, France, Germany, the Netherlands and Portugal. The authors of this article are faculty at the Institute whose students developed their MSc or PhD research in the lab. For additional details, online systems, papers and reports, see http://www.lis.ic.unicamp.br and http://www.lis.ic.unicamp.br/publications"
