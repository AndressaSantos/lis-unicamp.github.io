title: "Improving the QoS of Web Services via Client-Based Load Distribution"
abstract: "The replication of a web service over geographically distributed locations can improve the QoS perceived by its clients. An important issue in such a deployment is the efficiency of the policy applied to distribute client requests among the replicas. In this paper, we propose a new approach for client-based load distribution that adaptively changes the fraction of load each client submits to each service replica to try to minimize overall response times. Our results show that the proposed strategy can achieve better response times than algorithms that eagerly try to choose the best replica for each client."
