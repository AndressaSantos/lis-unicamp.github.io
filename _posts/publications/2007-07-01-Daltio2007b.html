title: "Um Serviço de Ontologias para Sistemas de Biodiversidade (An Ontology Service for Biodiversity Information Systems)"
abstract: "Biodiversity research requires associating data about living beings and their habitats, integrating from geographical features to domain specifications, often through ontologies. In this context are the so-called Biodiversity Information Systems, new management solutions that allow researchers to analyze species characteristics and their interactions. The goal of this project is to specify and develop an ontology web service that can be used for different biodiversity systems. The main contributions of this work are: specification of the requirements of an ontology service; and the specification and the implementation of an ontology server. This research is directly connected with the first challenge (management of large multimedia data volumes), and provides support to research in challenge 2 (computational modeling in complex systems)."
