title: "Publication and Integration of Scientific Workflows on the Web"
abstract: "Scientific activities involve complex multidisciplinary processes and demand cooperative work. This entails a series of open problems in supporting this work ranging from data and process management to appropriate user interfaces for softwares. This work contributes in providing solutions to some of these problems. It focuses on improving the documentation mechanisms of processes and making it possible to publish and integrate them on the Web. This eases the specification and execution of distributed processes on the Web as well as the reuse of these specifications. The work was based on Semantic Web standards aiming at interoperability and the use of scientific workflows for modeling processes and using them on the Web. The main contributions of this work are: (i) a data model, which takes Semantic Web standards into consideration, for representing scientific workflows and storing them in a database. The model induces a workflow specification method that favors reuse and integration of these specifications; (ii) a comparative analysis of standards proposals for representing workflows in XML; (iii) the proposal of a Web-centered architecture for the management of documents (mainly workflows); and, (iv) the partial implementation of this architecture. The work uses as a motivation the area of environmental planning as a means to elucidate requirements and validate the proposal."
