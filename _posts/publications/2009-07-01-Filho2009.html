title: "Mechanisms for Semantic Annotation of Scientific Workflows (Mecanismos de Anotação Semântica de Workflows Cientificos)"
abstract: "The sharing of information, processes and models of experiments is increasing among scientists from many organizations and areas of knowledge, and thus there is a need for supply mechanisms of workflow discovery. Many of these models are described as scientific workflows. However, there is no default specification to describe them, which complicates the reuse of workflows and components that are available. This thesis contributes to solving this problem by presenting the following results: analysis of issues related to the sharing and cooperative design of scientific workflows on the Web; analysis of semantic aspects and metadata related to workflows, the development of a Web-based workflow editor, which incorporates our semantic annotation model for scientific workflows. Given these factors, this work creates the basis to allow the discovery, reuse and sharing of scientific workflows in the Web."
