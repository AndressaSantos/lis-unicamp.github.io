abstract: "Most of research data handled by biologists are in electronic spreadsheets. They became a popular technique to create data tables, which are easy to implement as isolated entities, but are inappropriate for integration with other spreadsheets or data sources and for enhanced queries, due to the informality of their implicit schemas. Several initiatives aim to interpret these implicit schemas of spreadsheets, making them explicit in order to drive the extraction and mapping of native data to open standards of interoperability. However, we observed limitations in such interpretation process, which is detached of the spreadsheet creation context. In this paper we present a strategy for characterizing spreadsheets, centered in their creation context, and we investigate how this characterization can be used to improve an automated interpretation and mapping of their respective schemas in the Biology usage domain. The strategy presented here is supporting a work in progress of a tool to automatically recognize spreadsheet schemas."
