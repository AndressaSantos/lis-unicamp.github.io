title: "Granulometric analysis of cell nuclei texture: Design of computational tools and application in biological models"
abstract: "The chromatin texture of cell nuclei is a special concern for pathologists, because it can reflect metabolic changes, proliferative activity, nutritional state and cell differentiation. This work intends to enhance knowledge about image texture assessing granulometric features, to find in the literature different methods of residues extraction. Three groups of granulometric methods were implemented, such as: A) Classic granulometry, that operates with structuring elements; B) Granulometry by area closing or volume closing, that builds a component tree; C) Granulometry by H-basins closing, using geodesic reconstruction. The different methods were compared each other, using two image sets from biological models: Model I: Analysis of chromatin changes of cardiomyocytes during hystological development of 89 Wistar rats, between 19 days after conception and 60 days after birth. In order to obtain hematoxylin-stained cytologic preparations, the formalin-fixed samples were KOH-hydrolysed for 18 hours. Number of mitosis and granulometric parameters had a similar Spearman correlation coefficient with age, around -0.77. The chromatin texture becomes smoother with ageing, reflecting the progressive cell diferentiation of cardiomyocytes. Model II: Detection of chromatin texture differences between nuclei of three lung neoplasias and normal tracheobronchic cells. Cytologic brush smears, hematoxylin-eosin stained, collected during bronchoscopic exams of 117 patients, divided in 4 groups, were compared each other. The granulometry which uses structuring elements classified correctly 68.4% of cases. Among the residues-extraction techniques, the extraction of H-residues by geodesic reconstruction showed more significative results in the first biological model. Classic granulometric features had better performance to classify the image groups in the biologic model II. Residues-extraction by area opening or volume opening seemed to be fast and efficient methods. The granulometric residues are capable to provide useful information from chromatin texture, as demonstrated in nuclear changes during development of myocardium and between human lung cancers."
