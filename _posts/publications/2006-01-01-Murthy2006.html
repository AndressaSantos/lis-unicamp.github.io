abstract: "In this demo proposal, we describe our prototype application, SIERRA, which combines text-based and content-based image retrieval and allows users to link together image content of varying document granularity with related data like annotations. To achieve this, we use the concept of superimposed information (SI), which enables users to (a) deal with information of varying granularity (sub-document to complete document), and (b) select or work with information elements at sub-document level while retaining the original context."
