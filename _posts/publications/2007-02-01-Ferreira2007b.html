title: "Image retrieval with relevance feedback based on genetic programming"
abstract: "In the last years, large digital image collections are generated, manipulated, and stored in databases. In this scenery, it is very important to develop mechanisms to provide automatic means to retrieve images in an efficient and effective way. However, the subjectivity of the user perception of an image usually hampers a fully automatic search and retrieval. Relevance Feedback is one of the commonest approaches to overcome this difficult. In this paper, a new content-based image retrieval framework with relevance feedback is proposed. This framework uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the user needs. The objective of this learning method is to find a function that combines different values of similarity, from distinct descriptors, and best encodes the user perception of image similarity. Several experiments are performed to validate the proposed method, aiming to compare our work with other relevance feedback techniques. The experiment results show that the proposed method outperforms all of them."
