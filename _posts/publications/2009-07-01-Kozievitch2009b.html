title: "Evaluation of a Tablet PC image annotation and retrieval tool in the parasitology domain."
abstract: "The project Deployment and Assessment of an Image Annotation and Retrieval Tool has the objective of specifying and implementing an application for image support annotation and search (based on a textual and a visual description) in the biodiversity domain. This technical report presents the activities related to the use of the tablet PC tool in the parasitology domain at Unicamp. The objective of this tool is to help the comparison of morphological characteristics among different species. The report is divided into activities accomplished, application setup and specific features, followed by experimental results and conclusion. Preliminary results showed that students regarded the tool as being very useful, contributing as an alternative learning approach."
