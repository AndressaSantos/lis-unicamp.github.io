title: "Access Structure for Moving Points"
abstract: "Several applications require management of data which is spatially dynamic, e.g., tracking of battle ships or moving cells in a blood sample. The capability of handling the temporal aspect, i.e., the history of such type of data, is also important. This paper presents and evaluates three temporal extensions of the R-tree, the 3D R-tree, the 2+3 R-tree and the HR-tree, which are capable of indexing spatiotemporal data. Our experiments have shown that the while the HR-tree was the larger structure, its query processing cost was over 50% smaller than the ones yielded by the 3D R-tree and the 2+3 R-tree. Also compared to the (non-practical) approach of storing one R-tree for each of the spatial database states it offered the same query processing cost, saving around one third of storage space."
