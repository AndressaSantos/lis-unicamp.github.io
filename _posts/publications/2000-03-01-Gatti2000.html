title: "Factors that Affect the Performance of Spatial Join Methods: a Study Based on Real Data"
abstract: "Synchronized tree traversal join methods for spatial access methods were analysed. The factors considered included bufferpool size, page size, intermediate join indexes ordering criteria, bufferpool page replacement policies, among others. This analysis was based on real data taken from a GIS application for telecommunications, indexed on a R*-tree. Results of this work assess the way those factors affect spatial join performance and can be used for tuning such methods."
