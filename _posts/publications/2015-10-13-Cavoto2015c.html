booktitle: "Proceedings of Satellite Events of the 30th Brazilian Symposium on Databases 2015 (SBBD 2015)"
title: "ReGraph: Bridging Relational and Graph Databases"
abstract: "In this paper, we present ReGraph, a framework to map data from a relational to a graph database, managing a dynamic coexistence and evolution of both, not supported by related work. ReGraph has minimal impact in the existing infrastructure, providing a flexible and tailored graph model for each relational schema. It uses an initial ETL (Extract, Transform and Load) process to replicate the existing data in the graph database. A scheduled service is responsible for reflecting changes in the relational data into the graph, keeping both synchronized. ReGraph also provides an annotation functionality that allows users to add new information in the mapped graph, providing the materialization of inferences and data
enrichment."
