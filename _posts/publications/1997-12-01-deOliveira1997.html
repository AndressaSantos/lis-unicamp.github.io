title: "Design and Implementation of User Interfaces for Geographic Applications Systems"
abstract: "This thesis presents a framework of techniques and models to support the design and implementation of user-interfaces for geographic information systems (GIS). The proposal combines concepts from three areas of computer science -- Databases, Software Engineering and Human-Computer Interfaces -- in a innovative perspective, considering interactions not only with the user, but also with the underlying software. The framework covers both the architecture of the interface and the mechanisms for its construction. The basis of the interface-GIS integration is an object-oriented geographic database. The presented solution can be mapped to most of the existing interface development tools. The main results of the thesis are: a software architecture for the design and implementation of user-interfaces for geographic applications systems; an interface objects model for building user-interfaces which can be modified at run-time (dynamic interfaces); an interface customization mechanism based on active databases; and the creation of reusable interface components geared towards geographic applications. The techniques and tools introduced in this thesis were applied on the design and implementation of user-interfaces for two geographic applications systems, in urban and environmental areas. The results of this experience showed that this work contributes to diminishing the costs and improving the efficiency of the development of geographic interfaces."
