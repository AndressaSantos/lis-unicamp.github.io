title: "Access Control in Multiversion Geographic Databases"
abstract: "Geographic applications are increasingly influencing our daily activities. Their development requires efforts from multiple teams of experts with different views and authorizations to access data. As a result, several mechanisms have been proposed to control authorization in geographic databases or to provide the use of versions. These mechanisms, however, work in isolation, prioritizing only either data access or versioning systems. This dissertation addresses this issue, by proposing a unified authorization model for databases that faces both problems. The model deals with the access control issue in geographic databases, taking into account the existence of data versioning mechanisms. This model may serve as the basis for cooperative and secure work in applications that use Geographic Information Systems (GIS)."
