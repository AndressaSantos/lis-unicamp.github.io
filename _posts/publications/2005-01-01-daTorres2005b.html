title: "An Environment for Managing Images and Spatial Data for Development of Biodiversity Applications."
abstract: "There is a wide range of environmental applications requiring sophisticated management of several kinds of data, including spatial data and images of living beings. However, available information systems offer very limited support for managing such data in an integrated manner. This thesis provides a solution to combine these query requirements, which takes advantage of current digital library technology to manage networked collections of heterogeneous data in an integrated fashion. The research contributes to solve problems of specification and implementation of biodiversity information systems that manage images of species, textual descriptions and spatial data in an integrated way."
