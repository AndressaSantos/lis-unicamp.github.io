title: "Multiscale Dataspace for Organism-centric Analysis"
abstract: "Biologists increasingly need a unified view to understand and discover relationships among data elements scattered along data sources with different levels of heterogeneity. Existing approaches usually adopt ad-hoc heavyweight integration strategies, requiring a costly upfront effort involving a monolithic chain of steps to handle specific formats/schemas, with low or no reuse. This article proposes an original framework based on scales aligned with the dataspaces on demand integration principle. Scales systematize and encapsulate integration in discrete steps, fulfilling the dynamicity of the process through reuse of previous scales and localized customization. Although the proposed framework can be extended to several scenarios, this work focuses on the biology domain addressing the organism-centric analysis scenario."
