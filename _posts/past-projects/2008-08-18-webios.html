excerpt: The goal of the project is to provide scientists who work in environmental/biodiversity issues with a system that supports exploratory multimodal queries over heterogeneous biodiversity data sources. These sources include images (photos of living beings or their habitats), geographic data, ontologies, domain-specific metadata, as well as data on collections, species and so on."

<p>Welcome to the WeBIOS home page. WeBIOS is an eScience project developed at the<a href="/"> Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS)</a> of the <a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/">Institute of Computing (IC)</a> at the <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/">University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil</a>. It is conducted jointly with researchers from the <a href="http://www.ib.unicamp.br/">Institute of Biology</a> and the <a href="http://www.nepam.unicamp.br/nepam/">Center of Environmental Research (NEPAM)</a> at UNICAMP.</p>
<p>The goal of the project is to provide scientists who work in environmental/biodiversity issues with a system that supports exploratory multimodal queries over heterogeneous biodiversity data sources. These sources include images (photos of living beings or their habitats), geographic data, ontologies and domain-specific metadata.</p>
<p>WeBIOS is the recipient of a <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft eScience</a> grant. It is also partially funded by grants from Brazilian funding agencies</p>
<p>FAPESP, CNPq and CAPES.</p>
