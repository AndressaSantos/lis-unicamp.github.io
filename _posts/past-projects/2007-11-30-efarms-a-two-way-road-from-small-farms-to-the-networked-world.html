    Welcome to the e-Farms home page. E-farms is a project developed at the <a href="/">Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS)</a> of the <a href="http://www.ic.unicamp.br/">Institute of Computing (IC)</a> at the <a href="http://www.unicamp.br/">University of Campinas (UNICAMP)</a>, Brazil. It is conducted jointly with researchers from <a href="http://www.feagri.unicamp.br/">FEAGRI (Agriculture Engineering)</a> and <a href="http://www.cpa.unicamp.br/">CEPAGRI</a>.</p>
<p>e-Farms is a multidisciplinary project combining research in Computer Science and Agricultural Sciences. Its goal is to attack theoretical and practical problems involving agricultural (sensor-based) data management, and low cost wireless data communication in rural areas in Brazil.</p>
<p>This project will take advantage of existing infrastructure at UNICAMP &#8211; the Information Systems, Wireless, Microsoft Interoperability and Geoprocessing labs, and experimental farming grounds at Agriculture Engineering.</p>
<p>e-Farms is a project financed by the FAPESP-Microsoft Research Virtual Institute.</p>
