excerpt: "The goal of the project is to specify and develop computational tools to allow biodiversity researchers to manage and share data, helping them in the construction of complex models and in ecosystems modeling, including the discovery of relationships and interactions between species. Based on Web services, these tools will help support the cooperation between researchers in biological sciences belonging to groups with different interests and vocabularies."

    <strong>Biodiversity and Computing Research</strong>
</p>
<p>BioCORE is an eScience project developed at the Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS) of the Institute of Computing (IC) at the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil. It is conducted jointly with researchers from IME-USP (Computational Vision Laboratory), UNIFACS and from the Institutes of Biology at UNICAMP and USP. The goal of the project is to specify and develop computational tools to allow biodiversity researchers to manage and share data, helping them in the construction of complex models and in ecosystems modeling, including the discovery of relationships and interactions between species. Based on Web services, these tools will help support the cooperation between researchers in biological sciences belonging to groups with different interests and vocabularies. Bio-CORE is funded by a grant from CNPq, and partially funded by grants from FAPESP and CAPES.</p>
