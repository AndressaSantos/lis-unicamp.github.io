excerpt: "Research on climate change necessarily involves integration of data collected at multiple scales on space and time, as well as interaction and cooperation of people from very many disciplines, scientific profiles and backgrounds. The same kind of scenario occurs in many other research initiatives -- e.g., in health (where integrated studies require analysis from molecule to human and back)."

<h2><span style="color: #008080;"><strong>Project Overview</strong></span></h2>
<p>Research on climate change necessarily involves integration of data collected at multiple scales on space and time, as well as interaction and cooperation of people from very many disciplines, scientific profiles and backgrounds. The same kind of scenario occurs in many other research initiatives &#8212; e.g., in health (where integrated studies require analysis from molecule to human and back). The goal of this project is to look at these problems from a data point of view, investigating mechanisms that allow presenting such heterogeneous data in a coherent manner, thereby facilitating data sharing and reuse, and scientific collaboration across fields. The algorithms and tools developed within the project will be tested against two real case multiscale scenarios, in agriculture and biodiversity.</p>
