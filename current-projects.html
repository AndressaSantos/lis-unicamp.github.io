The idea is to adopt the notion of scientific workflows as the basis to specify executable models, and create a common computational platform to design, annotate and reuse such workflows. This infrastructure will provide a common data infrastructure to all researchers in the Center for Computational Engineering &amp; Sciences (CCES) (a.k.a. eScience Unicamp). The CCES scientists will test/apply the data and models used and/or produced by the Center in the infrastructure.</div></li>

Perspectives are defined following an adaptation of the concept of views in relational databases – i.e., each perspective is handled as a view in the graph database. Following relational theory, a graph view is defined in terms of a view generating function: a combination of operations that represents queries applied to existing database objects – i.e., vertices and edges.  Since there is no consensus on a formal definition of graph data model, the first challenge addressed by our research was to formalize the operators for graph data that underpins our framework. As a result, we define PGDM – a property graph data model – together with its operators. For uniformity, all results of graph operators in PGDM are graphs. Our second contribution lies in the definition of the framework itself, based on the use of PGDM.</div></li>

The same kind of scenario occurs in many other research initiatives -- e.g., in health (where integrated studies require analysis from molecule to human and back).</div></li>

The same patient visits different health center for many reasons, such as to treat another medical specialty or due to geographic displacement. Access patient's medical history requires data sharing among healthcare centers. The ability to exchange data among computational systems is called data interoperability. Besides technical issues, clinical data interoperability is moreover hampered by ethical and security issues, by the absence of consensus about standards and terminology, and by...</div></li>

From a partnership between Laboratory of Information Systems (LIS) and Fonoteca Neotropical Jacques Vielliard (FNJV) of the Institute of Biology of the University of Campinas (UNICAMP) as part of the NavScales project, the main goal of this project is to design a tool which supports multiple algorithms to help scientists and general public on the identification of species.</div></li>
